Covid testing: Patient with cough will receive PCR covid test. Patient instructed to self-quarantine until test results come back. Sick note will be provided to his work.

Patient will continue to check at-home glucose levels and should report to physician if levels are hypoglycemic or if he begins to feel symptoms of hypoglycemia such as lightheadedness. Patient encouraged to modify diet but is reluctant at this time. Check hA1C, renal function panel for signs of end-organ damage related to diabetes. Patient counseled to get eye exam and to self-check for non-healing wounds of the feet. 2. Chronic fatigue: Check CBC and CMP for iron/ electrolyte abnormalities that may be contributing to chronic fatigue. If values are within normal limits, schedule follow-up appointment to explore other etiologies of chronic fatigue. 3. Health maintenance: Patient encouraged to get colonoscopy.

","Firstly, I would like to start with some basic labs on him since I haven't seen him in so long. I would get labs of CBC, CMP, HgbA1c, TSH, to evaluate for any abnormalities. Following this I would like to meet with him in a week to talk about whether we may need to add any medications to his current regimen. I also forgot to ask about lifestyle modifications during today's visit so would like to discuss that in greater detail at his next visit.

I was also worried about missing something serious such as lung cancer given his smoking hx and the fact that he hasn't seen a physician in so long.  ","The first thing I would get is a covid test. Thinking about it now, it would also be reasonable to get a chest X-ray. If covid test is positive, I would then discuss with him importance of self-isolating for the specified time period. If negative, this is most likely another viral infection so would recommend supportive treatment. However, would want close follow-up in another two weeks to discuss how his symptoms are. If they are not improving, consider other sources of infection and think about other risk factors that we didn't discuss today such as sexual hx for possible HIV exposure, TB status, etc. ","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","9 (strongly disagree)","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","9 (strongly disagree)","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","27C1891,25C1075,30C739,26C663,31C850,27C867,22C761,22C775,24C795,28C756,26C732,29C910,30C678,32C613,28C596,24C647,21C561,23C496,25C514,31C690,END","16C2347,4C1130,8C1228,15C1199,19C917,14C1428,6C733,3C823,17C818,12C834,11C724,1C960,7C920,18C873,10C900,5C3560,9C769,20C747,13C1021,2C740,END","8C1423,28C948,16C1037,24C788,2C1137,22C726,17C826,27C989,9C814,31C832,14C899,25C697,10C1044,26C717,1C931,23C703,13C879,30C891,11C1054,29C737,END","10C1230,23C780,5C778,27C905,1C2013,30C815,8C1353,26C712,11C746,30C1275,17C3326,32C681,18C847,23C710,2C1021,25C676,7C649,22C566,13C681,26C720,19C832,24C527,12C693,21C512,9C853,29C703,3C690,28C728,15X6021,31C997,4C1251,28C966,20C1904,31C758,16C1074,24C764,14C1990,25C1081,6C800,27C721,END","21C3921,27C1008,31C949,23C876,29C786,31C965,30C620,22C647,21C598,29C631,23C801,22C651,21C617,26C491,31C696,27C691,26C631,26C781,29C614,24C1200,32C2501,25C702,26C621,31C609,28C876,28C658,23C937,32C1222,27C1599,21C1066,28C1149,29C1717,24C661,24C580,22C706,25C536,30C717,30C584,25C591,32C626,END","15C1580,30C904,9C1006,21C743,11C1198,23C1729,12X8220,25C1183,6C1712,28C777,19C742,24C1075,5C1273,31C769,14C725,22C839,8C1728,27X5572,1C1082,32C826,END","13C1012,29C755,17C1248,21C969,12X4130,28C921,2C1279,26C702,4C698,25C958,7C799,26C784,9X5384,21C797,3C746,22C1144,11C930,23C1085,8C637,25C672,14C2179,27C1551,5C620,24C616,6C603,32C1081,19C695,30C909,18C914,28C761,16C862,31C721,15C834,23C868,10C675,32C901,1C790,29C670,20C737,31C845,END","","","","","","","","NA10BUBR","10C1230,23C780,5C778,27C905,1C2013,30C815,8C1353,26C712,11C746,30C1275,17C3326,32C681,18C847,23C710,2C1021,25C676,7C649,22C566,13C681,26C720,19C832,24C527,12C693,21C512,9C853,29C703,3C690,28C728,15X6021,31C997,4C1251,28C966,20C1904,31C758,16C1074,24C764,14C1990,25C1081,6C800,27C721,END","13C1012,29C755,17C1248,21C969,12X4130,28C921,2C1279,26C702,4C698,25C958,7C799,26C784,9X5384,21C797,3C746,22C1144,11C930,23C1085,8C637,25C672,14C2179,27C1551,5C620,24C616,6C603,32C1081,19C695,30C909,18C914,28C761,16C862,31C721,15C834,23C868,10C675,32C901,1C790,29C670,20C737,31C845,END","8C1423,28C948,16C1037,24C788,2C1137,22C726,17C826,27C989,9C814,31C832,14C899,25C697,10C1044,26C717,1C931,23C703,13C879,30C891,11C1054,29C737,END","15C1580,30C904,9C1006,21C743,11C1198,23C1729,12X8220,25C1183,6C1712,28C777,19C742,24C1075,5C1273,31C769,14C725,22C839,8C1728,27X5572,1C1082,32C826,END",0.27394380525461

Once we have those numbers, it will be good to change the medications to SGLT2 inhibitors and to address any kidney function issues that may be happening which would depend on albumin and creatinine levels. I wanted to schedule a follow-up with this patient after starting new medications to ensure we are addressing the fatigue and urination frequency so that we can improve the patient's quality of life. Depending on the lipid panel it would also be important to possibly start a statin to reduce MI chances and atherosclerosis.","8","9 (strongly disagree)","4","9 (strongly disagree)","3 (somewhat agree)","1 (strongly agree)","9 (strongly disagree)","1 (strongly agree)","1 (strongly agree)","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23C1020,28C1643,22C1043,30C1524,26C1045,32X3232,22C1035,25C1280,31C1247,25C887,27C1081,23C1417,29C791,27C721,29C666,21C707,24C757,30C757,21C758,32C644,END","7C1015,1X1672,5C930,6C765,13C899,17C843,14C1064,3C835,15C1000,18X1326,4C1076,12C982,10C780,20X1718,16C140,8C963,11C1008,2C886,9X1542,19C930,END","19C997,29C865,1C1224,32C1169,4C1228,26C994,9C1220,23C826,12C884,24C825,11C1129,27C680,17C680,25C697,5C646,22C800,6C1221,31C985,13C682,30C781,END","14C1171,21C757,10C610,24C777,8C765,27C885,13C859,23C938,17C773,25C840,2C630,23C740,9C780,29C951,20C896,26C1156,1C669,26C854,16C758,22C875,3C647,30C923,18C1136,30C665,7C817,28C830,15C661,21C759,5C671,27C899,6C746,31C741,11C737,22C686,4C698,32C648,19C755,29C1178,12C827,31C786,END","25C742,32C781,26C896,29C789,23C805,21C618,24C701,25C676,21C624,31C619,28C824,22C717,22C583,32C833,30C864,29C712,26C983,24C677,27C783,28C690,21C724,28C736,24C617,26C869,30C762,25C670,32C893,27C787,23C703,30C720,26C709,24C661,27C813,23C626,28C950,29C783,22C647,31C912,31C620,30C716,END","2C781,25C739,18C829,21C684,11C770,27X2473,3C1449,29C1058,1C780,31C870,19C1008,32C868,20C703,22C862,8C588,24C635,12C873,26X1068,6C1515,28C870,END","3C676,25C646,11C685,24C688,10C1176,21C528,7C730,31C695,18C608,23C646,4C923,26C720,2C1099,26C641,9C698,28C876,6C877,29C820,14C666,25C692,19C755,24C1082,8C673,27C779,20C1448,32C1367,5C1141,23C866,15C673,31C839,16C801,28C484,1C711,29C825,13C732,27C678,17C907,30C726,12C725,22C578,END","CL0328BR","3C676,25C646,11C685,24C688,10C1176,21C528,7C730,31C695,18C608,23C646,4C923,26C720,2C1099,26C641,9C698,28C876,6C877,29C820,14C666,25C692,19C755,24C1082,8C673,27C779,20C1448,32C1367,5C1141,23C866,15C673,31C839,16C801,28C484,1C711,29C825,13C732,27C678,17C907,30C726,12C725,22C578,END","14C1171,21C757,10C610,24C777,8C765,27C885,13C859,23C938,17C773,25C840,2C630,23C740,9C780,29C951,20C896,26C1156,1C669,26C854,16C758,22C875,3C647,30C923,18C1136,30C665,7C817,28C830,15C661,21C759,5C671,27C899,6C746,31C741,11C737,22C686,4C698,32C648,19C755,29C1178,12C827,31C786,END","2C781,25C739,18C829,21C684,11C770,27X2473,3C1449,29C1058,1C780,31C870,19C1008,32C868,20C703,22C862,8C588,24C635,12C873,26X1068,6C1515,28C870,END","19C997,29C865,1C1224,32C1169,4C1228,26C994,9C1220,23C826,12C884,24C825,11C1129,27C680,17C680,25C697,5C646,22C800,6C1221,31C985,13C682,30C781,END",-0.0243604390619454
