"1","  Hi there, Thomas.  You are muted, Thomas.  It should be on the left hand corner, lower corner where there is a little picture of a microphone.  There we go."
"2","  I am good.  How are you?"
"3","  Yeah?  You would like to go by Tom?"
"4","  Dana. "
"5","  Nice to meet you.  Well, tell me what is bringing you into the virtual clinic?"
"6","  Gotcha.  So when did your symptoms start?"
"7","  Okay.  And I know you mentioned the cough, but what other symptoms do you have?"
"8","  Gotcha, okay.  Have you had any fevers?"
"9","  Okay.  And have you had any loss of the sense of smell or taste?"
"10","  Okay.  Any shortness of breath?"
"11","  Okay, okay.  When you cough is anything coming up?"
"12","  Okay, gotcha.  Two weeks ago or up to three weeks ago, did you come in contact with anyone you know of that had COVID?"
"13","  Okay.  Have you had COVID before?"
"14","  Have you had any other COVID vaccines?"
"15","  Okay.  Do you interact with people a lot in the work or just kind of in your daily life or do you tend to stay at home?"
"16","  Gotcha, gotcha, okay.  And have -- tell me, I think we didn’t have much on your file for past medical history, do you have any other medical problems that are more long-term that you have been working with?"
"17","  Okay.  Do you take any medicines?"
"18","  Gotcha, okay.  Has that been helpful?"
"19","  Okay, okay.  All righty.  Well, it sounds certainly like just in the last few weeks you have had some symptoms of what sounds like kind of common cold symptoms, but other, nothing super severe, does that sound about right?"
"20","  Prior to two weeks ago would you say you were feeling your normal sense of health or did you notice anything else going on?"
"21","  Okay, okay.  Well, I still think COVID-19 is a possibility.  It has -- sounds like it has been two weeks, so we would want to test you, but there is a chance you could still be positive if you had COVID.  Other possibilities could be the common cold which could cause similar symptoms, and then there is the more kind of discrete things that we would think about.  So I am going to ask a couple of questions that might sound a little strange and they are pretty low on my concern list, I just want to be sure.  Do you have any family history of cancer?"
"22","  Gotcha, okay.  And have you had any issues with blood in your stool?"
"23","  Okay, gotcha.  Any blood when you have been coughing up, the white phlegm you are describing?"
"24","  Okay.  And do you smoke cigarettes?"
"25","  Okay.  No tobacco use.  And then do you drink alcohol?"
"26","  Okay.  Okay.  I am trying to just get a good idea on a scale of 1 to 10 how concerned about your symptoms are you?"
"27","  Gotcha, okay.  Okay, well based on what you are saying and the fact that your concern is pretty low, you don’t look super sick today on the camera and what you are describing is in the meeting not scaring me.  I think it would make sense to get you a COVID test ordered and if that’s normal then I think we will probably chart this out most likely to common cold.  Unless your symptoms keep going for a long time and then in that case we would start to worrying and I want you to give us a call if you are still feeling these cold symptoms two more weeks go by and you were not COVID positive and we are calling this a cold then we start to get worried if we are hitting over a month.  So, one other thing I would want to just talk to you about is if do you have any questions about the COVID vaccine, any interest about that that I can address today?"
"28","  Gotcha.  Well I appreciate, I hear, it sounds like you are doing your research and as a physician I am a fan of it because we are seeing it affect people in the hospital, the ones who do get COVID they are not the ones in the ICU on the ventilator.  Those are the ones who we can usually send home pretty quick.  So I do think it is helpful, but just ______ for that I am here if you have any other questions but, in the meantime we will get you a COVID test ordered and you can do that and then again if that’s positive, then we will contact you with kind of the rules about isolation and kind of watching your blood or your blood sat ratio, oxygen sat ratio and if there is any concern about, and you are needing to come into the hospital.  And then if it is negative we will just kind of think of this as a cold for now, but if symptoms do not go away in the next two weeks I want you to give us a call back.  Okay?"
"29","  I think that would be great and what we could do is, we could get you a blood test just to kind of get a baseline of how your health is.  The blood is like the window to the whole body. So we can order you some bloodwork and then you are also at the age for a colonoscopy.  But if you are open to we can order that, but I also understand if you want to think about that, it might be better to have that discussion have an establishing care with a family medicine doctor and you can really kind of go over the nitty-gritty of what the colonoscopy is like and what other screening tests you can get done.  But I would be happy to order some bloodwork today to just kind of get that ball rolling and then we can make sure you get set up with a family medicine doctor."
"30","  Yeah, well based on what you are describing you sound like a pretty healthy guy.  Yes, I do like when patients come in every year for just a checkup, so I would love to get you kind of set up with a doctor that you can see every year just to make sure you keep being this healthy of a guy."
"31","  Any other questions or concerns?"
"32","  Yep, yep, we will make, you can come in to the clinic and get your COVID test and your bloodwork on a Saturday, that is totally fine."
"33","  I do not."
"34","  Oh."
"35"," That sounds pretty cool, you got it.  You have got to check that out, well I will let you go.  You can go and enjoy and hail."
"36","  Okay."
