"1","  Hello.  Can you hear me?"
"2","  Good morning, good afternoon.  My name is Fabio, I’m a first-year medical student at the University of Washington.  Can you verify?"
"3","  Perfect."
"4","  Can you verify your date of birth for me you know just to make sure?"
"5","  Okay, all right, Freddie.  So, I have here on your chart that you’re here for a routine diabetes checkup care visit.  Can you tell me little bit more about what’s been going on?"
"6","  Any symptoms that have been flaring up recently?"
"7","  Yeah, how many grandchildren do you have?"
"8","  Yeah, it seems like a lot of work there.  So, I also have here on your chart that you are having trouble standing for more than two hours, can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"9","  May I ask where you work again?"
"10","  All right.  Do you feel like you are standing a lot at your job as well or you’re more sitting down kind of?"
"11","  All right.  Can you remind me again when you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes?"
"12","  And how do you think those have been working for you?"
"13","  Any specific differences from when you started it versus now or?"
"14","  Is there or is not there, sorry?"
"15","  Okay, that’s good.  And do you check your blood glucose pretty often throughout the day?"
"16","  You’re out of the test strips.  Are you just needing to pick up some more or what?"
"17","  And so 241 is a little bit high, was it right after your meal that you checked it or were you fasting before you checked it.  When was the last time?"
"18","  After breakfast, okay.  So, it’s not abnormally high but still."
"19","  And those strips are a little bit expensive, is there any like financial burden to that?"
"20","  All right, so here I have that you’re having trouble standing for more than two hours, you’re here for just the diabetes checkup, you do have increased fatigue for the past six months and you’re on glipizide and metformin that’s been helping?"
"21","  Is there anything else you would like to add before we kind of move forward from?"
"22","  All right.  Do you have any childhood illnesses that you can recall?"
"23","  Okay and for your past medical history we have type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia which is high cholesterol."
"24","  Okay and we have hypertension here, high blood pressure, do you have that as well?"
"25","  Okay, all right, so, any other medical history that you would like me to add here to your chart?"
"26","  Okay, perfect, it sounds good.  You always got to start again somewhere and then go with the momentum, so."
"27","  All right.  So, for the medication I have here glipizide and metformin, any other medication that you’re on?"
"28","  Any vitamins or supplements?"
"29","  Sounds good and any allergies to any medication or anything?"
"30","  Okay, all right and this next part of the interview, we ask every single patient just about health related behaviors.  We’re going to talk a little bit about diet, exercise, tobacco usage.  I’ll just run through these, one by one okay?"
"31","  All right.  So, diet and exercise, how would you say your diet and exercise is?"
"32","  Okay, all right.  So, it sounds like a little bit high on the sugar in the morning with your coffee cream and some fast food.  Would you agree with that a little bit?"
"33","  Yeah, okay and then any tobacco usage?"
"34","  And alcohol you said a glass of wine."
"35","  Okay, any recreational drug use?"
"36","  Okay, any concerns with your sexual activity today?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  We have to ask this to every patient."
"39","  And how about immunization which, are you up today on your immunizations?"
"40","  Okay and how about your flu vaccine, have you received the flu shot?"
"41","  And for your family medical history, do you know if any of your family, do you know about any of your family medical history?"
"42","  Yeah, let’s start with your father and then we’ll go from there?"
"43","  So, is this your mom or your dad?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Okay, may I ask how your father passed?"
"46","  Natural."
"47","  Sounds like you have a pretty healthy family just the diabetes there with your mom."
"48","  Yeah."
"49","  Yeah."
"50","  That’s good, that’s diet and exercise is the number one thing for diabetes and it’s very hard to maintain but, yeah."
"51","  Okay and for last part here, I am going to ask you a little bit about what you do, you said you work at a shipping company?"
"52","  Okay."
"53","  How long have you work there for?"
"54","  Do you like your job there?"
"55","  Yes, it’s true.  Do they provide pretty good health insurance for you?"
"56","  I don’t want to be in the Twitter age either, I don’t like that."
"57","  I don’t want to be in this age either, it’s much better face to face than over the phone."
"58","  Yeah."
"59","  I’ve been feeling the same way here.  So, other than like taking care of the grandkids, what else do you like to do for fun and around the house?"
"60","  How long do you walk every day?"
"61","  Any other exercise?"
"62","  And do you believe you have any financial struggles?"
"63","  Yeah, are you currently in Washington or?"
"64","  Northwest, all right.  I think I got all the information here.  So, it is a little bit worrisome that you’re having trouble standing for more than two hours and it looks like your previous labs here.  I don’t know if you’ve been educated about A1c levels hemoglobin?"
"65","  So, you do want to be checking that, you want to be checking your glucose levels pretty often just to make sure?"
"66","  Yes, and then A1c levels, it looked like last year it was 7.9 and if it’s fine with you, I’d love to do another A1c level, just to see where you’re at today?"
"67","  If you can come in after this telehealth."
"68","  And diabetes does have a lot of complications with the high cholesterol juice.  So, maybe we can just keep track of that as well if that’s something you’re okay with too."
"69","  Okay and you for your high blood pressure we can always just look at your blood pressure here today and go from there to see if it’s still doing."
"70","  We don’t like giving meds.  For my recommendation for you would be really, really stemming from the diet and exercise especially with your A1c level, your A1c is only at about 7.9."
"71","  Okay, sounds good."
"72","  Is this, sorry, I got confused with this whole study thing but it’s not what you mean by the woman and I’m sorry I didn’t understand that statement?"
"73","  Yeah, well, maybe you guys can kind of tag team and you can cook once in a while, she can cook once a while and you know and then there is a good middle point with your diet and exercise but."
"74","  We can do both, I guess."
"75","  Yeah, essentially the medical world doesn’t feel like we need a start on any other medications or start you on insulin unless your A1c is above 9% when you come in."
"76","  So, I really want to, I think the main thing for you is increasing your exercise a little bit if that’s possible maybe walking you know slowly walking five days a week if that’s possible."
"77","  Five days a week and then kind of going down on the amount of fast food and the amount of cream you’re putting in your coffee and I think that’s really going to make a difference."
"78","  Yeah. Is there any other questions you have for me?"
"79","  I’m sorry but I like just kind of spilling all my recommendations out and then whatever you think about, you can do or can’t do."
"80","  Okay, I think it’s best to tag team it, so."
"81","  Yeah, so, all right Freddie.  If you don’t have any other questions for me, if you would like to."
"82","  Yes.  If you would like to come in and we can talk some more and look at your A1c levels and that sounds good to me."
"83","  All right.  I think we’re all done here with this."
"84","  No problem, whenever you’re ready."
