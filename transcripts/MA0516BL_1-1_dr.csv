"1","  Hi there Tom.  My name is Jourie Reddick, I am one of the first year medical students and I am working with you today to hear about what’s been going on with you lately.  Do you prefer going by Tom?  Oh, I think you are muted.  Sorry.  So, let me do the unmute Tom.  Sorry Tom, one second."
"2","  There we go.  Now I can hear you.  Sorry about that."
"3","  Oh."
"4","  Well you know what the good thing is I am here to listen to you, what’s been going on lately, so if your story changes a little bit I think that’s okay."
"5","  Okay.  Thank you for letting me know that.  By the way if I am looking down at all, well I listing, just because I am taking notes  I definitely will be listing to you but so, it sounds like you had a bit of cough.  Have you been around anyone that you for sure you know has had COVID?  It sounds maybe your partner was around children but any known contacts with COVID."
"6","  Okay."
"7","  Of course, no worries."
"8","  Okay, wonderful.  So it sounds like you had a bit of a cough, what about any other symptoms?"
"9","  Absolutely yeah.  No of course.  I am glad you haven’t had anything else that’s been going or bothering you.  Had, and like no fever, no aches, no chills, nothing like that?"
"10","  Okay, okay.  Is coughing something that you notice will happen with like different times of the year.  Do you ever notice that?"
"11","  Okay and how is it been impacting your daily life.  Do you feel like it has interrupted your usual activities at all?"
"12","  Okay.  Are you currently taking any other medications besides DayQuil?"
"13","  Okay, and do you feel like the DayQuil has been helping at all or not really?"
"14","  Yeah.  Okay.  So, just help get me a better picture of you know what’s been going on lately, I want to ask a couple of questions about just kind of your own past medical history.  Do you have any, you know, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or anything like that before?"
"15","  Okay, okay and do you have any family history that is worth noting to me, you know some people have very strong genetic things in their family, anything like that that you can think of?"
"16","  Okay, okay, thank you for sharing that, and I am just going to move into a couple of health behaviors for you as well, just help get me a good idea.  Do you have any history of smoking or tobacco use?"
"17","  Okay.  Any alcohol use at all?"
"18","  Okay, and then what about any sort of like diet or exercise routine that you typically follow?"
"19","  Okay and has this current cough even having has that limited your ability to exercise or do those things that you normally would or has that been okay?"
"20","  Okay.  Well, it sounds like to me, Tom, maybe you just have one of these colds that’s going around right now.  The fact that you don’t have a fever, you haven’t had any chills, you don’t know anyone who has had COVID right next to you, is a good thing, and I am curious that have you gotten an antigen test or done any sort of rapid test for COVID at all since this cough started?"
"21","  Okay, and also are you up to date on your COVID vaccines and your flu vaccines?"
"22","  Okay.  That’s okay.  So, I think with that in mind, I think it could be really good idea to just order a test for you, just to be sure and cover our bases and make sure that, you know, if it is COVID, we catch it early or if it is flu, even though it is not really as much flu season around, still can go around for a long time and so I think that that will probably be the next best move, but I am very encouraged by the fact that you haven’t been having a lot of other symptoms.  The only thing that I, you know, would keep in mind is something that, you know, we have to check if it is walking pneumonia or it is kind of lingering viruses or bacterial things that people can have but just kind of keep noticing the cough is there and so it sound like this is going on for about a week and so I think what I would like for you to go Tom is first get a COVID test and then get a flu test and we can get those ordered for you, and then if in another week, the cough is still not gone, I would like you to reach back out to me and let me know and at that point, I think it might be good to just do a couple of other tests and make sure that we are not missing something else.  How does that sound to you?"
"23","  At least get tested, yeah, and you know, I obviously as a doctor I am someone who is going to promote vaccines too and I understand that can be a very personal decision and I would love to talk to you more about any, you know, concerns that you have in regard to vaccine, if you are nervous about getting vaccinated and so if that is something you want to discuss today, we can but we can also bring that up at a future appointment, whatever you feel comfortable with, but mainly I just want to make sure that you are taken care of and so, I think that if we can figure out if this is COVID or not, that’s the best first step."
"24","  Yeah."
"25","  Oh, sorry, so is yours.  Wait a second, let’s see if it comes back.  Like it’s so curious, that good, oh there we go.  You're unfrozen now."
"26","  Absolutely, yeah, and I do too.  So, I think I would like to monitor first, especially since it sounds like you don’t have a lot of other risk factors right now that would make me very concerned for something more serious but I also don’t want to miss something serious, like you said, if that is what is going on, so for now continue to take DayQuil, even potentially taking some ibuprofen or Tylenol or alternating between the two if you are having any sort of pain with your cough or any sore throat, noticed anything like that and getting that COVID antigen test and the flu test, and then depending on the results of those, I would like to see you again if those symptoms continued."
"27","  Do you have any questions for me?"
"28","  Okay, yeah.  Have you noticed that you have lost any weight recently?"
"29","  Yeah, no worries.  Have you, when was the last time you had a colonoscopy done?"
"30","  Okay, okay.  Thank you for bringing that up because that is something that sounds like it is hard to deal with.  Its not an enjoyable thing to go through, but that is something that is important for me to know and I think with that in mind, it may be a good idea to try and get you scheduled for a colonoscopy soon, just because I think that may give us a better indication of why the diarrhea is going on, but I also think you know there are a lot of causes for diarrhea that we can investigate as well.  Is the colonoscopy something that you would be open to doing?"
"31","  Unfortunately, they are not and I am sorry you did hear correctly.  They are not very fun to go through and I think that there may be a few other things you could do first before we need to move you to that, but as a general screening measure, we do recommend that people at your age do have them, at least frequently enough that if there were something going on we could catch it sooner rather than later.  So, is there anything else besides the diarrhea that has been going on that you have noticed?"
"32","  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I definitely think that that sounds like it should hopefully be a reasonable plan going forward and then in regard to the diarrhea, I think that you know, I would like to, next time, I have you back in office for real visit, I think I would like to schedule an in person visit with you so that I could do a physical exam and we could run a couple of labs and just a couple of tests to give us a better indication of what’s been going on with that and then pending that results, maybe look into a colonoscopy moving forward but that is something that would be more on a horizon, especially since this is something that isn’t as acute, you have been dealing with this for a little while, sounds like."
"33","  I think you know, it sounds like you do a very good job at taking care of yourself and your health, so, I just want to applaud you on that and thank you for checking in with me because it’s you know these things can feel small, but when they affect your daily life and also like you said you know, you just want to make sure it’s not something more serious, so, I just want to thank you for coming in and talking to me about this.  I know that moving forward you know, you are going to be in good hands and we are going to make sure that we treat you know everything that’s going on, since its cough right now but if there is anything else that comes up to, I am here for you and I want to make sure that we address that as well."
"34","  Wonderful.  That sounds like a great plan.  Alright, Tom.  Thank you so much for seeing me today."
"35","  Yes, Jourie, Jourie with a J."
"36","  Take care, was nice to meet you."
"37","  Bye."
