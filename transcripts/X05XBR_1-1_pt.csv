"1","  Do you see me now?"
"2","  Hi."
"3","  I could be doing much better, but I am doing okay."
"4","  Congratulations.  I know you’re pretty excited about that."
"5","  Yes, I would imagine."
"6","  Well, my girlfriend has been challenging me and pushing me to come in and get checked out for possibly the COVID virus.  I have a little cough that I’ve had and so she just wants me to kind of get tested and find out if there is anything more going on."
"7","  Uh huh."
"8","  About five days now."
"9","  No."
"10","  No, just, just a little warm sometime but nothing unusual."
"11","  No, no."
"12","  Occasionally yes."
"13","  Do I feel stressed you say?"
"14","  No, no."
"15","  Yes, when I cough now with a little tickle in my throat, I get a little phlegm."
"16","  It’s like an off-white color."
"17","  Just a little bit, just enough to clear my throat."
"18","  Yes, I’m pretty much in to stay on my daily routine.  I sometimes, I’m just a little tired and maybe sleeping a little more than usual but other than that, no other symptoms."
"19","  Not that I am aware of, no."
"20","  No traveling, no."
"21","  No recent traveling."
"22","  Well, I always generally wear my mask outside.  I am a construction worker and so I am out in the fresh air a lot and when I get close to people, I pull the mask up, but other than that, I just use normal precautions."
"23","  I would say it’s about the same.  Like I said my girlfriend she is just concerned that I should get it at least checked out but it’s about the same, I’ve had a cold before."
"24","  Such as?"
"25","  No."

"38","  No, right now, I just want to make sure that everything is okay."
"39","  You know I think it would please my girlfriend, I would like to know that."
"40","  At least, I am going to get tested for, so."
"41","  I think that should be our guess."
"42","  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"43","  Yeah, yeah."
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Well, no, you pretty much answered my question.  I think getting the test would alleviate you know stress on her part, that’s the reason I am here you know because she has been you know been bugging me to come in, so __________ that can at least assure her that yes you know I am going to get tested and we’ll take it from there."

"48","  Thank you."
"49","  Thank you."
"50","  I appreciate it."
"51","  Okay, the same Candice, alright.  Take care."
"52","  Bye, bye."
