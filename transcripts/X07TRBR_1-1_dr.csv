"1","  Hello, is this Freddie?"
"2","  Hi Freddie.  Do you go by Freddie or Mr. Jones?"
"3","  Nice to meet you Freddie.  I'm Eva, I'm a medical student and I'll be chatting with you today."
"4","  So, so I read your chart a little bit.  I understand that you're here to talk about your diabetes and may be some other concerns.  Is that correct?"
"5","  Okay.  So tell me what things you want to make sure that we address today?"
"6","  Okay.  Well, I'm glad you came in today.  When you say your numbers are climbing up, which numbers are you referring too?"
"7","  Okay, the sugars that you take at home?"
"8","  Okay.  And what's your sugars been ranging at home?"
"9","  Okay.  And how often are you taking your blood sugars?"
"10","  Okay.  And what times during the day?"
"11","  Okay, okay, so your blood sugars, we'll talk about that for sure, and what else, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?"
"12","  Okay.  We can certainly talk about that.  So how long ago did you start to see your sugars start to climb up?"
"13","  In the last week, last month?"
"14","  Which one?"
"15","  The last week, okay.  And what's the highest that you've seen it?"
"16","  Okay.  And what medications are you currently taking?"
"17","  Glipizide.  How often are you taking your metformin?"
"18","  Every day most of the time, okay.  Do you take it once a day or twice a day?"
"19","  Okay, morning and night?"
"20","  And this is your 500 mg?"
"21","  Okay.  And how do you take your glipizide?"
"22","  Do you take that once a day, twice a day?"
"23","  Morning?"
"24","  Or evening?"
"25","  Morning, okay.  And this is your 10 mg?"
"26","  Any changes in your medications lately?"
"27","  Okay.  Have you noticed any other symptoms?"
"28","  Okay.  How long has that been going on?"
"29","  Okay.  Any belly pain?"
"30","  Okay.  Headaches?"
"31","  Do you have trouble with sensation, feeling things in your fingers or toes?"
"32","  All right.  So just the peeing a lot?"
"33","  When you go to the bathroom does it hurt when you're peeing?"
"34","  Okay.  Any fevers?"
"35","  Okay, so other than the sugars and kind of peeing a lot, you're otherwise okay?"
"36","  Okay.  Tell me more about that."
"37","  Hmm.  That must be really hard.  It sounds like you really care for your grandkids."
"38","  Oh, how old are they?"
"39","  They keep you very busy?"
"40","  Okay, well and they live with you?"
"41","  Okay, I see, that's very exciting.  It must be really hard not being able to keep up with them?"
"42","  Yeah.  And how long has that been happening?"
"43","  It's been a while?  Okay.  How do you think you're feeling otherwise?"
"44","  Yeah."
"45","  Okay.  Do you think you're having trouble sleeping?"
"46","  Okay.  You go to the bathroom pretty often even at night?"
"47","  Okay.  And have you had any back pain?"
"48","  Okay.  And you said the last time you went and saw a doctor was about a year ago?"
"49","  And you've not seen anybody for any of this so far, is that right?"
"50","  Okay.  Do you take your blood pressures at home?"
"51","  Okay.  Do you take any medications for your blood pressures?"
"52","  Have you had any headaches?"
"53","  Okay.  And feeling like your heart is beating too fast?"
"54","  Okay.  Okay, I think, I think quite a few of the things that you are telling me that sound like it's related to your diabetes.  What are your thoughts about that?"
"55","  I think, I think, going to the bathroom pretty often and kind of feeling tired can be a sign that there is a lot of sugar in your system and your body is trying to get rid of the sugar with going to the bathroom and of course your body is kind of on overdrive, so you're feeling kind of tired.  And you are telling me that your sugars are climbing up from what you can see.  So I'm wondering if it's worthwhile for us to adjust your medications a little bit, so that we can see if you can get the sugars under control a little bit more."
"56","  Yeah.  What's going through your mind right now?"
"57","  Yeah, I think, you know, you've certainly gotten into a routine with your medications and then it can be hard to make those adjustments.  But I also want to make sure that you're feeling good and have good energy and we can get rid of some of these symptoms and like going to the bathroom or feeling tired or waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and so that you can have better energy and be able to spend time with your grandchildren too."
"58","  Yeah.  What will be your thoughts on us increasing the dose of your metformin, but you take it at the same time every day still, so this is very minimal adjustments, but it would bring down your sugars?"
"59","  Yeah, thatâ€™s my hope for you as well.  What I would recommend is, so we are taking 500 mg twice a day, I think what we can do is, let's see here, you last came in to get your labs drawn at the end of March, so that was about a month ago, and so we don't, we don't necessarily need to do that again and, but what we can try is bumping up that metformin to a 1000 mg in the morning, so two pills instead of one in the morning and see how that is.  What are your thoughts about that?"
"60","  Yeah.  I think that would be able to help us and get your sugars down a little bit, and at the same type Freddie, in order for us to kind of track how you're doing and get a little bit more data about this, I think it will be really helpful for us to have more data points on your sugars, so we can figure out how exactly to adjust your blood sugar medications.  What are your thoughts on taking your sugars like when you take your medications in the mornings?"
"61","  Yeah, that's really great.  I think with that we'll be able to better control your medications to optimize them.  Are you there?"
"62","  Okay.  How does all of that sound so far?"
"63","  Okay.  And lastly, I think with these changes, I'd love to see you back in a couple of weeks so we can check in again and adjust as we need and just to see how you're doing and may hear about what your grandkids have been up to."
"64","  Okay."
"65","  What questions do you have for me?"
"66","  We can get that started tomorrow."
"67","  Yeah, I understand.  Great and we'll have the scheduler make an appointment with you in a couple of weeks."
"68","  Okay.  And so just to summarize everything that we've talked about to make sure that we're on the same page, and that I've explained myself correctly, could you tell me what our plan is?"
"69","  Yeah.  So we're going to increase the dose from 500 to 1000 just in the morning and then and take the blood sugars at the same time when you take the medications before you take your morning meds will be best."
"70","  Okay.  I think that's a good place for us to start.  I don't want to make too many changes, because it sounds like you've got a good regimen.  I think at our next visit we can talk about what our next steps are and how things are going."
"71","  Okay.  What questions do you have for me?"
"72","  Okay, great.  I'm so glad we were able to talk.  It was nice to meet you Freddie.  I'm going to see you next time."
"73","  All right.  So I think this ends our visit for me.  I'm not sure how this works on Zoom and with this research study it sounds like you've probably had more experience than me in that regard."
"74","  Thank you."
"75","  I see here."
