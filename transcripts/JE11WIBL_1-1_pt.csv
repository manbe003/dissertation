"1","  What about now?"
"2","  Hahaha."
"3","  It worked."
"4","  Excuse me, I was not supposed to have technical problems this morning, however."
"5","  Oh yes."
"6","  Tom, Tom works for me, hmmm."
"7","  Well, it’s been about 10 years since I have had a doctor’s visit and my girlfriend is just kind of concerned I have a cold, cold symptoms and it has been going on for a few days and so she is a little concerned and maybe I am a little concerned that it could be COVID and so I was wondering should I be tested today."
"8","  Well, it’s been about five days now that I have had this cold and just a runny nose and occasionally, I will cough, cough up some phlegm."
"9","  It’s like an off-white color."
"10","  No."
"11","  No, not really.  My girlfriend, she is a teacher, so that may be a part of her concern as well that she may have passed it on, but I don’t think so."
"12","  No, no."
"13","  I, not really.  Occasionally I feel a little warm, I feel maybe around 99."
"14","  Hmmm."
"15","  No."
"16","  No, no."
"17","  Oh yes, I have been sleeping a little more than usual.  Yes."
"18","  No."
"19","  Oh, sure, sure…hmmm."
"20","  Well, I have taken or I am currently taking Dayquil, okay.  Just for my cough, hmmm."
"21","  Well, I only take it as needed and sure it gives temporary relief for a few hours and then you know I maybe 4 or 5 hours I have to take it again."
"22","  No, no."
"23","  No."
"24","  Yes, two to three beers a day."
"25","  No."
"26","  No."
"27","  Well, first I just want to make sure that it’s not COVID, so it’s the main purpose and like I said my girlfriend has been pushing me and encouraging me to come in because it’s been about 10 years since I have been into the visit, so do you think there is anything else since I am here that you want to check out?"
"28","  Hmmm."
"29","  Okay.  Okay."
"30","  Alright."
"31","  Okay, okay.  Alright.  That sounds good…hmmm."
"32","  Oh, okay.  So don’t have to wait a week for the results."
"33","  Right."
"34","  Oh, okay.  Okay, alright."
"35","  No, I think that that takes care of it and again I just wanted to have this visit to first to satisfy myself and my girlfriend that I don’t have COVID, so and it’s a great relief to know that from your analysis from what I have told you that, that's why I am still standing, so that’s a good thing."
"36","  Okay, alright.  That sounds good, okay."
"37","  Bye, thank you so much, okay."
"38","  Bye-bye."
