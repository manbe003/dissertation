"1","  Hello Tom, my name is Matt.  I am a medical student from the University of Washington School of Medicine.  How are you doing today."
"2","  Okay, alright.  I have been sent in to see how you are doing and what we can do for you.  Tell me, you say you are sick? Tell me about it."
"3"," Yeah."
"4","  Yeah, yeah."
"5","  I am glad you are here.  I am glad you are here.  If you do not mind me asking, what has kept you away from the doctor?"
"6","  Okay.  Well. I am glad you are coming in now.  There are some things that we can do to help prevent illnesses down the road, like immunization, stuff like that, but we can talk about that after we talk about your cold."
"7","  Tell me about your cold, it states five days runny nose."
"8","  Cough. Yeah, productive."
"9","  Okay.  Is it ever blood-tinged?"
"10","  No. okay.  And do you have a chronic cough or is this something kind of new."
"11","  This is new? "
"12","  Got it.  Congestion?"
"13","  Okay.  Sorry.  Any fevers or chills?"
"14","  Okay.  A quick question.  You say you felt more fatigued.  Has that just been for the last five days or has that been longer?"
"15","  Just last five days, okay?  Any muscle aches or body aches?"
"16","  Okay.  How is your sense of taste and smell?"
"17","  Okay, alright.  Well that is that is good.  And then because of COVID, do you have any known exposures to COVID?"
"18","  Okay.  "
"19","  Okay, okay that that is good.  Can I ask what you do for work?"
"20","  Okay, alright.  And then how many people are in your house?"
"21","  Okay, perfect."
"22","  Good, awesome. That is great."
"23","  Yeah, that is good.  I feel that you probably have a cold.  I think you probably were hit, you know, on the head and I want to order a COVID test just to be sure.  They are not as expensive as they used to be.  They are covered by most insurance but there are a few things that I think man, we should talk if you are here, you know, you look a lot younger than your stated age and so you are due for a few things that might help you maintain your health.  I am sorry, have you ever smoked?"
"24","  No. okay.  And then any family history of any cancers?"
"25","  Okay."
"26","  Awesome."
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Okay,  How old was he? Do you know?"
"29","  Okay.  Well, that is one of the things we want to screen for, actually.  When you turn 50, actually, we are supposed to screen you for colon cancer.  There are many different ways you can do this.  Routinely people think of a colonoscopy, and that is one way we can do it.  There is also now blood tests, what is called a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is a very much less invasive test.  I would love to schedule you for that because of your family history of cancer and because of your age."
"30","  Yeah, that is the one."
"31","  Well, well, I am actually trained to give colonoscopies and we can give you a little something so you are not, you would not be conscious during it and I think it is very important for your health if you absolutely say, no, doc, we are not doing colonoscopy, there is a blood test we can do and we do that blood test every year."
"32","  Yeah.  Would you rather do that instead of the colonoscopy?"
"33","  Okay, okay.  Well, I will put in an order for that.  There are a few other things I think we should talk about as well.  Have you been vaccinated against shingles?"
"34","  No?  Shingles is the chickenpox, and you know, we all had chickenpox as a kid and it actually lives inside of us the virus but it is dormant, our immune system keeps it dormant.  Sometimes as you age it can pop back out, but it does not pop out as chickenpox.  It travels along your skin, and it becomes a very, very painful rash.  But we have a great immunization against it.  Can I tell the nurse to line one up for you?"
"35","  The shingles shots, all the immunizations are covered by insurance. "
"36","  Yeah.  Would that be something I could interest you in?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  What do you mean you are stuck."
"39","  Yes.  So shingles has an interesting course that it can come and it can go.  Some people have what is called postherpetic neuralgia and it is a painful skin area that is where the nerves have been damaged and so we can prevent it.  It is not usually what happens, it usually comes and goes but why risk it?  You know, get vaccinated?  Alright.  There are a few other vaccines I want to actually talk about as well.  Have you been vaccinated against pneumonia?"
"40","  Okay.  I would like to line in one of those up for you.  It is a simple shot.  It is a pneumovax, and that can prevent pneumonia in lots of people.  So I want to get that one lined up and you are definitely eligible and then have you been vaccinated against COVID?"
"41","  Okay, yeah, you know what we have in office, if you would like, we can do the first dose today and we will hold off the other vaccines. "
"42","  Would that be okay"
"43","  Yeah, yeah.  There is we have the Moderna and the Pfizer AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, we have them all here."
"44","  I guess."
"45","  Yeah.  So, some people with the two doses have a bit of a side effect of what seems like a very mild flu symptoms, especially with the second dose.  This would be a low-grade fever, some fatigue and malaise.  Most people do not have any side effect other than redness at their arm.  There have been a few instances of serious side effects.  There has been and the amount of those, it is like, I think it is less than 0.1 of 1%.  I can look this up for just a second, so they are very uncommon.  Yes so."
"46","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, I just looked up the risk of adverse events is 2 -5 per million, so it is pretty rare."
"47","  Yeah, okay.  So I will line that one up for you, and then, I am sorry, let me look at your chart for just a second as well, okay, alright, and then do you drink, Tom?"
"48","  It is very rarely, okay."
"49","   I am sorry, but maybe a good thing and then."
"50","  Okay, okay, and then? And I am not the police, I do not tell anyone, but do you use any drugs?"
"51","  Okay, okay, alright.  And how is your relationship with your girlfriend?"
"52","  Good. You feel safe at home."
"53","  Well, good for her.  Thank you.   Send her my thanks.  "
"54","  Okay.  Well, I think after getting those things lined up.  Uh.  We do not have any labs for you and I think it would be good to have some baseline labs as well.  We will check your sugars, we will check your lipids and we check just your baseline chemistry just to make sure that, you know, maybe your sugars are creeping up or we can detect problems long before they become a noticeable problem with the blood work.  Would it be alright if I schedule that for you?"
"55","  Yeah, well, our nurse Jackie comes in and it is just a simple blood draw and just, you know, out of your vein and she fills up two tubes, two tubes because we can run multiple tests with it.  It checks your thyroid, it checks your kidneys, checks your liver, and we can run all of that just to make sure there are no problems creeping up. "
"56","  Okay, alright.  Well, I am sorry to give you the whole one over.  There is a ton of things, but I am glad you came in today.  I think for that you are cold.  We will run that COVID test and if it is negative, we will just say, hey, stay home, which you are probably doing, get plenty of rest and liquids, and if it does not go away in a week, let me know. okay?"
"57","  Okay. Do you have any questions for me?"
"58","  Okay."
"59","  Okay, Let us see more of you. okay.  Especially if this does not go away or you have any other symptoms, you know, reach out and then I like seeing my patients once a year.  So I would love it if you would say, you know what, now it is time to see the doctor once a year, we could schedule that. "
"60","  Alright. Well, Tom, it has been a pleasure.  I hope you have a wonderful day."
"61","   Thank you. Really, have a great day."
