"1","  Hi, Mr. Jones, how are you today?"
"2","  Good.  My name is Nathan Maris.  I am a fourth year medical student, seeing you for your diabetes visit today.  It is a pleasure to be able to take care of you."
"3","  I guess before we get started, tell me about any, the most important thing that you want us to address with this diabetes visit today."
"4","  Hm, hm."
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Gotcha.  Yeah, I can see where that would be stressful, you know, you want to be able to keep up with your grandkids and…"
"7","  Ha ha ha, that is such a fun age."
"8","   That is the age where they are fun, but they, they get into everything right? Ha ha."
"9","  Well, gotcha.  Um, you mentioned just this feeling of tiredness.  So how long do you feel like this has been going on for, that you haven't been able to keep up?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Hm, okay.  And that feeling of tiredness is accompanied by any other sensation and any pain in your, you know, hands or feet, anything like that?"
"12","  Just, just fatigue."
"13","  Okay, okay.  Um, and that has been going on for six months that, that you have been having this.  Has it ever happened to you before?"
"14","  Yeah."
"15","  Okay.  How do you feel like you have been sleeping?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Do you wake up feeling refreshed?"
"19","  Okay, good.  And just for kind of a reference point, do you and your wife sleep in the same bed?"
"20","  Okay.  Does she notice that you snore at all?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  Gotcha.  Okay, I guess I will get information and maybe we can track back if it is okay with you.  Talk about your diabetes a little bit and then track back at the end of the visit, to talk about how your, your tiredness is affecting you because I have some thoughts about things that we might, first steps that we might take if that is okay?"
"23","  Great.  Um, so how do you feel like your diabetes management has been going?"
"24","  Gotcha."
"25","  All right, ha ha."
"26","  Ha ha ha."
"27","  Okay, okay, when, when people, I can definitely understand when people kind of, you know, pointedly tell us about those sorts of things.  There is maybe a different way about having that conversation.  So I am sorry that you had that experience with the healthcare system."
"28","  Gotcha, okay.  Well, I am glad to hear that you know, that you feel like things have been going, going well, I guess, you know on that topic, what, what does a day, you know, a normal day of meals look like for you?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Yeah."
"31","  Hm, hm."
"32","  Okay and what that.."
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Ha ha.  It's, it's hard not to pass up.  And when I was in college, one of my roommates worked at Ezell's and he would always bring the leftovers back and so, I would have fried chicken."
"36","  It is good fried chicken, ha ha ha.  It is really, really good.  Okay and then what about your, what is physical activity or exercise look like for you in a week?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  Great."
"39","  Okay.  Where do you like to walk?"
"40","  Yeah."
"41","  Sure.  Yeah, you gotta with exercise.  Otherwise, you know, you don't want it to become routine."
"42","  Yeah.  Ha ha ha, right."
"43","  Exactly.  Um, and then also, just looking at your, your chart, I see that you're on metformin and then the glipizide.  How has taking those been, any, are you able to purchase your medicine okay? remember to take it every day? any barriers to Medicaid?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Fantastic yeah.  It sounds like you are, you are really sticking to your, your regimen.  Well, well, thanks for sharing all that information.  I know that sometimes, you know, it can feel intrusive to have your, your healthcare team asking every little detail of your, your living.  So, I appreciate you sharing all that info with me."
"47","  One thing and, you know, I know that you had a less than savory experience with your last healthcare team.  So, I want, I want to ask your permission before I make any kind of recommendations, because you know, medicine being a team sport, you know, it is like you said, I want to stay as far away from talking down in any way, shape or form to you.  Do you mind if I just chat about your labs and see where we go from there?"
"48","  Awesome.  Yeah, I am gonna pull up your A1c.  So that's the blood test that we do.  We like to do it every three years, or sorry, excuse me every three months."
"49","  Yeah, exactly.  So, yeah, it tells us kind of an average basically of your blood sugars over the past three months.  And I do notice I just have your most recent one pulled up here, that you know, your, you have gone up just a little bit to 7.9.  And so you are, you were back in 2019, fantastic at 6.9, doing amazing and you know, it's, it's, we just like to be able to monitor those values, so that we can make some decisions as a, as a group or some recommendations as to see, you know, maybe how we can improve your control because I do suspect that having high, high blood sugars here and there is, is making you feel a little more tired."
"50","  But, and that's kind of circling back to the sleepiness.  But I am wondering if just from the story that you have shared if I might be able to ask about the soda that you're drinking, if that's okay with you."
"51","  So is that diet or do you, is that usually sugary soda?"
"52","   Yeah, ha ha."
"53","  Gotcha."
"54","   Ha ha, exactly.  Devil you know, the devil you don't.  So I suspect that the sugary sodas are actually probably what is driving the, the blood sugar values up the most you know, when we have a liquid with sugar in it, our body absorbs it a lot quicker than if we are having say ice cream or something solid."
"55","  And so that makes our blood sugar spike a little bit more.  And so I am wondering what your thoughts would be about maybe one of those meals starting off, one of those meals a day having water instead of soda.  What would be your thoughts on that?"
"56","  Hm hm."
"57","  Yeah."
"58","  Yeah, they, they will definitely give you a cup of water with your meal and, you know, when we are making changes to diets, we like to do things step by step because it helps our, you know, train our, our tastes and our brain to, to, to accept those changes a little bit better.  And so yeah, asking for water is a great option to do when you go there."
"59","  And then, you know, if you're feeling like a next step, replacing the fries with a salad is always a good option.  But again, we can take this step by step this is a…"
"60","  Yeah."
"61","  Great."
"62","  Yeah."
"63","  Perfect."
"64","  Awesome.  Um, that sounds like a, you know, great, great step from here.  And then kind of as we are, as we are wrapping up here, I am wondering if I could just chat about the other things that I, I think might be or could be causing you to feel tired if that is okay."
"65","  So, um, the other thoughts that I have, um, there's, there's a few things that we can, we can check lab wise.  So if we have an anemia or too few red blood cells that can make us feel tired."
"66","  If our thyroid is not producing as much of a hormone, that can make us feel tired."
"67","  And then you meant, we talked about snoring just a little bit and I am wondering if you know, something called sleep apnea.  Have you heard of that before?"
"68","  Yeah."
"69","  Yeah."
"70","  I am glad you haven't."
"71","  Ha ha.  And you know, some people have like your friend have that sort of dramatic, like, ""Oh, I feel like I am choking"" and they wake up.  But some people have, it's a little more subtle and maybe they are not waking up as much.  But they are waking up just a little bit, so that they do not remember it, but they are not getting good quality sleep."
"72","  And so if it's okay with you, what I would like to do is do a blood draw today.  And then I would also like to give you a referral to a sleep medicine doctor.  And they can actually do those tests in your home now.  So, you don't have to go to an uncomfy hospital bed and not sleep all night."
"73","  That would be perfect too, yeah."
"74","  But does that sound okay to you?"
"75","  It's, there is one doctor that specializes in, in kind of quality of sleep.  And usually what they'll do is they'll send you home with some equipment that they kind of put it onto you and you can, it'll tell you, tell them if you have sleep apnea."
"76","  Yeah, yeah.  It's nice now you don't have to go to a hospital or …"
"77","  Ha ha ha, they're terrible places to get sleep."
"78","  Well, Mr. Jones, we talked about quite a bit today.  So, we talked about the soda for your diabetes and then some labs and this referral to the sleep study.  What questions do you have about all that?"
"79","  Hm, hm."
"80","  Yeah."
"81","  Hm, hm."
"82","  It sounds good.  Um, is it okay if we see you back, I'm actually on in the labs that we draw.  We don't need any extra blood for this.  I am just going to check your, your A1c again if it is okay."
"83","  Just to see where you're at, because we're about three months out from your last one."
"84","  And then if it's okay with you, I would like to see you back in six weeks to see how the decreasing soda is going.  Does that sound okay with you?"
"85","  We can even do this over the phone or over telemedicine again, if that is easier for you."
"86","  Oh."
"87","  Yeah."
"88","  Ha, ha ha.  We butt heads with, it seems like there's, there's always that one person in our life."
"89","  And, you know, I have to, before we go I have to just thank you for, for the work that you've been doing in the past year.  I imagine that trying to prevent COVID from getting into a retirement home has been quite a nightmare.  So thanks for the work that you do for taking care of our elderly, you know, elderly citizens."
"90","  Well, Mr. Jones, you have a great rest of your day and we will see you in six weeks, okay?"
"91","  Nice to meet you."
