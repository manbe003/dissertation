"1","  Hello, there.  Are we all set?"
"2","  Yeah, I can and obviously, can you hear me, how are you doing?"
"3","  Great."
"4","  That’s correct.  What do you need to know?"
"5","  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head there.  Basically, I know I am supposed to check on my, you know, diabetes every four months or so and normally I do, but over this last year things have been different and so it’s been over a year now and one thing then another, you know make sure I am managing my diabetes the way I ought to and stuff, so."
"6","  I wish I could say it’s my pleasure, but it is not a fun thing to have I guess."
"7","  I am just tired all the time and kind of run in and out of energy."
"8","  I don’t know, I need more breaks at work.  The main thing is it’s just impossible to keep up with my grandkids now when I get home after work and basically my wife takes care when our daughter is at work.  So, anyways just they are eight, five and two and so they keep us all running, the 8-year old thinks she is in-charge.  So, but mostly she is in-charge of the 5-year old and kind of go along with whatever she says, so 2-year old and yeah."
"9","  Yeah indeed."
"10","  Yeah, they are and that’s my main concern as I want to make sure I can keep up with them and."
"11","  Yeah, pretty much, I don’t know, I am 60 now, I am getting towards the age of retirement and is this going to be the end of everything coming up, is it everything going to get worse every day or what.  So, I guess that kind of stresses me out too."
"12","  Yeah for sure."
"13","  I drink coffee you know most of the day anyway.  So, I try to take breaks, but I don’t want to be taking naps at work that just doesn’t give a good image, but I put in exercise too, I take a couple of walks during the week for a break, you know, take a 10 or 15-minute walk around the facility and get me out of my desk and stuff, but so I am working on the exercise part."
"14","  I don’t know, it seems like it’s just a gradual thing as I get older I get a little more tired and so, I don’t want to get it, let it get ahead of me, here I’m looking like maybe we could raise the dosage of my meds a little bit or something like that."
"15","  Yeah, we tried to keep it under seven or eight definitely under eight you know and so that’s kind of one of my goals.  So, we’re still there."
"16","  Well, I try, but I am getting tired."
"17","  I don’t know.  It seems like everything is pretty much working out okay except I am getting a little more tired and my numbers are gradually going up a little bit.  So, I want to make sure they don’t go up too high.  I definitely don’t want to end up on insulin."
"18","  Yeah, I keep a log, actually I took my glucose this morning, I was using about 215 this morning."
"19","  Yeah, usually around 200."
"20","  I guess basically this is my first time with you guys as a provider, all the records got forwarded obviously, so, but it sounds like, sounds like a plan if we can deal with the meds and."
"21","  Not that I know of, I guess not."
"22","  Yeah, the metformin and glipizide, which one are you going to change?"
"23","  Okay."
"24","  Oh, I did take 500 mg I guess twice a day."
"25","  Twice a day?"
"26","  It sounds good, yeah."
"27","  Okay, well thanks, you too."
