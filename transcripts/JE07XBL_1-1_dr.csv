"1","  Hey Fredrick Jones, my name is Kasey I think you are on mute still.  Bottom left corner for you.  Still can't hear.  I'll let you know when I can hear you.  It should be on the bottom left corner of your screen.  Just a sec, try hit, pushing the spacebar, holding the spacebar.  Oh, you got it."
"2","  I see you name Freddie on Zoom."
"3","  Do you prefer going by Freddie?"
"4","  My name is Kasey, my name is Kasey Cummins."
"5","  Nice to meet you, I am a first year med student with __UDaB__."
"6","  You as well.  Have you done Zoom appointments, virtual appointments before?"
"7","  Yeah, well you made it.  Can you see me just fine?"
"8","  Awesome, alright well welcome to Zoom."
"9","  Your first time seeing me as well so we have some things we want to cover, but I want to first just discuss how you are doing, what brings you to this Zoom meeting today and kind of what's going on in your life and in your health."
"10","  Great.  Absolutely, so I see that you have type 2 diabetes.  How long have you had that?"
"11","  And how has that been managing that?"
"12","  Okay, I see that you are taking metformin twice a day 500 mg and then glipizide which is twice a day 10 mg?"
"13","  Yeah, I am just looking at your chart.  Okay, okay so that's good to know. So you've been doing that for all eight years?"
"14","  I just see that's it is prescribed 10 mg twice a day with meals so then the metformin twice a day you've been taking glipizide once a day and you've been pretty consistent with that?"
"15","  Awesome.  How have your symptoms been, have you experienced any changing symptoms over the last eight years?"
"16","  Yeah, I hear you, I am sorry to hear that and that's been going on I have it written here that it has been going for about six months?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yeah.  What is it feel like when you say run out of steam or you just feel tired, can you put those feelings into words more than just tired?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Sure.  Have your sleeping habits changed at all or your level of activity during the day?"
"21","  Okay, you are not spontaneously hiking five miles a day now or sleeping two hours every night?"
"22","  Okay, okay.  Any changes to your diet or anything recently?"
"23","  That's great."
"24","  That’s great.  So outside just like you are on your normal routine as you have been and this fatigue is just creeping up on you?"
"25","  Okay.  Do you ever check your blood sugars?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","  Okay.  What have they been looking like if you had to put an average on them over the past month, two months to six months?"
"28","  Okay."
"29","  Yeah, I know this is a lot of recall for you but if you think back a few years what were your blood sugars usually running, I mean in other words do you feel like your blood sugars in the last few months have maybe running a little higher normal for you?"
"30","  Okay."
"31","  Okay.  Because what I've seen I have some of your A1c values from 2019 through last one was March of 2021 so just over a year ago probably your last time and they look like they were kind of a steady incline over those years as in your A1c was going up which as you might know correlates to just higher average blood sugars."
"32","  Have you had labs drawn anywhere else that I wouldn’t see since March of 2021?"
"33","  Sure, sure okay well I am sorry, that was the news that was handed down to you.  My goal is going to be how I can keep you healthy and let you live your life and you are going to be kind of guiding that path so if fried chicken on the weekend is what you are doing and that's what we're going to work around for sure."
"34","  Yeah, I also see that you have a history of hyperlipidemia but on no medications for that so just like high levels of fat in your blood, circulating cholesterol stuff like that."
"35","  I don’t see anything in here for it so I'll give you kind of maybe what I am thinking plan and see how this works for you.  I definitely want to get you to come in at some point and we'll get those labs drawn check where your A1c is at so we can get kind of touch base with where we're at there and then maybe do a lipid panel to see what your lipids are doing.  Do you live near somewhere that you can get blood drawn pretty easily?"
"36","  I'll have an after visit summery so I'll look up where the convenient labs are for you so you can just pop in get your labs drawn and get these all setup.  So we'll find somewhere near you that's convenient for you and then get these labs put in."
"37","  So we'll check A1c, we'll check your lipids and then what I am thinking in the meantime because that 215 is a little high and I know you said today it might be a little abnormal but since your blood sugars are kind of creeping up and from what I see from the A1c we have this upward trend that we should probably at least make sure that you are taking the glipizide twice a day as is prescribed.  Are you okay giving that a shot?"
"38","  No worries, not a problem."
"39","  So then we'll just because you are getting prescribed that we will just hop on board with that and then hopefully that second dose a day will help monitor these blood sugars or manage this blood sugars and then continue keeping an eye on it and see if you kind of notice changes in the coming weeks as we wait for getting labs back and stuff."
"40","  I think we can definitely explore some more medications, but I think that's definitely an appropriate conversation once we kind of see where your A1c is at because maybe you shock us all and that we just took trend down and we're right where we want you to be.  I have a suspicion that maybe your fatigue is from these higher blood sugars so as long as we just get these labs drawn and then we get you on that second pill we can continue talking about maybe additional medications or switching to things up if it is not working for you so I definitely want to find something that fits your lifestyle and with that I am assuming your doctor in the past maybe talked about lifestyle changes and managing blood glucoses for that, have you had discussions about that?"
"41","  Great."
"42","  Oh, absolutely I want you to keep living your life.  I think what we want to do is just manage risks and modify some of the things that can help manage those risks that you are willing to do so increasing exercise is going to be a huge benefit to managing your diabetes.  I wouldn’t ask you to cut out fried chicken especially because of the tradition that you have with your family and I want you to be happy with the life you are living but avoiding some of the simple sugars like candy bars and sodas will help you, I won't tell you what to do but they'll help some of your blood sugar problems and avoid some of those spikes but it is all give and take, right, so I just want to find a plan that works for you and just give you the information that's yours to do with."
"43","  So does that plan sound good to you?"
"44","  Okay, so repeat it back to me what we decided that we're going to have you do starting today?"
"45","  Okay, that's okay.  I'll put in your post visit summary printout so you'll have a hardcopy directions on what we're going to do."
"46","  But first we're going to have you take your glipizide twice a day with meals instead of once a day."
"47","  And continue taking your metformin twice a day with meals as you've been doing.  We're just making sure that the glipizide happens a second time a day and then we're going to have you get labs drawn so we can track your A1c and your lipid panel to see kind of where your basic labs are at."
"48","  Yeah, absolutely.  And then we will check back in once I have those values maybe in about let's say a month we'll schedule you back just another Zoom meeting in a month so that we can go over your lab values and we can get kind of feedback on how maybe some lifestyle changes have gone for you if you decide to exercise more or change some of your eating habits and how your blood sugars have been doing on the glipizide twice a day."
"49","  Does that all sound good to you, anything you would want to change or add?"
"50","  Okay and I just want to reassure you, I don’t want to make a 100 changes overnight and flip your life on a __Ted__ so we just, this will be long term relationship to help you get out of life what you are hoping to do and stay healthy."
"51","  Absolutely.  And I just want to reassure you that by tracking this theme of diabetes for you and your lipids that we will be addressing the fatigue that you are feeling that I hear you and it is top of my priority somewhat that's part of your lifestyle that I want to get you back on to.  So we will also revisit this.  Hopefully that fatigue is improved next time we talk with maybe better blood sugar management."
"52","  Okay, any questions for me?"
"53","  Okay Freddie it was a real pleasure meeting you."
"54","  That's okay so it should be the bottom right of your screen there is a red button that you need__."
"55","  And we'll see you in a month."
"56","  Yeah, take care.  Bye-bye. "
