"1","  Hello, Freddie."
"2","  How is it going?"
"3","  Well, thank you for coming in today.  I am Hadley Ganal.  I am a fourth year UDub medical student.  I will be helping to take care of you today."
"4","  I appreciate you coming in.  I had ________ that you are here to talk about your diabetes checkup and you have been having, been kind of tired."
"5","  Okay.  It gets away from us, doesn't it?"
"6","  Okay.  You keep an eye on, on your sugars at home?"
"7","  Umm, Okay.  I am glad you do that.  That is good to see.  Um, yeah, well, we can talk about that.  Anything else new going on?"
"8","  Yeah.  How have you been feeling with all the changes in it?  You know, it is quite stressful.  How's that been going for you?"
"9","  Okay.  Tell me a little bit more about that."
"10","  Okay.  Do you feel like you, you used to have the energy and this is new?"
"11","  And when do you feel like that started?"
"12","  Okay, okay.  Any other changes you noticed in the last month?"
"13","  Okay, okay and anything else you can think of?"
"14","  Okay.  And what kind of numbers have you been getting for your sugars at home?"
"15","  And that, is that new for you or it looks like you know, when you had been here, you know a little over a year ago, your A1c was a little lower.  But it seemed like those sugars have just kind of jumped up?"
"16","  Sounds good.  Have you been taking all of your medications?"
"17","  Umm, yeah.  How often?  Are you normally able to get around and taking them?"
"18","  Yeah, okay.  That is understandable.  Can you remind me which medications you have been taking at home, so that I, so that what I have is up to date?"
"19","  Yeah, it is a hard one."
"20","  I don't know who names these things.  Not me.  Um, okay.  And so you have been taking those most days of the week or how often?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  Okay, not too long.  Okay.  That's, that's fine though, okay.  And all right and here, um, okay, I am just going to run over things, make sure I am not missing anything.  Have you been having any headaches?"
"23","  Okay.  Any changes in your vision?"
"24","  Okay.  Changes in your thinking or speaking?"
"25","  How about any shortness of breath or cough?"
"26","  Any chest pain?"
"27","  Have you been able to, I know you have feeling tired.  Are you still able to kind of walk the same distance you normally can once you are..."
"28","  Okay.  And, and do you kind of feel tired overall? Or do you feel like weak like your legs might give out under you?"
"29","  Okay.  Any fevers or chills?"
"30","  Okay, okay.  And any belly pain?"
"31","  Nausea or vomiting or diarrhea?"
"32","  Great.  Hmm, well, you know, it looks like we did check your A1c, that's a number that helps us keep track of your diabetes.  It was not about a month ago, and it was a little higher, you know, than it has been in the past you were here a year ago.  And it sounds like your sugars have been a little higher, so I would like to recheck that again today.  And, you know, do you feel like you have had any major changes in your diet or exercise recently?"
"33","  Okay.  Well, you know, since your diabetes numbers have been going up, you know, it is important for us to keep those lower and if you are, when your sugars are too high, it can cause things like being too tired or peeing too much.  So, you know, I am interested in starting another, you know, I am interested in increasing your metformin and what do you think about that?"
"34","  Okay, yeah, I think it is a good idea.  You know, I think that your, your diabetes numbers being higher than normal, your sugars that could be causing some of these, these problems, and I think getting that number under better control will help you with that along with, you know, keeping your diabetes under control in general helps us to protect your heart, kidneys and brain.  So, yeah, I think that would be a good start, and so, I think we should double your metformin from 500 mg twice a day to 1000 mg twice a day, and then, we will check back in, let me know if you have any symptoms when we increase that medication."
"35","  Yeah.  Any, what questions do you have about that?"
"36","  Yeah, yeah.  I think that is very understandable.  I am glad you came in today, so that we can, you know, work together to try to get them under control and I think this is the best place to start."
"37","  Yeah, and then, we will check back in and how often do you normally check your sugars?"
"38","  Okay, yeah.  Do you think you could do it, you know, even twice a day for me for the next couple of weeks while we are trying to get things under better control?"
"39","  I know."
"40","  I know it is difficult and I know, I know, it takes a lot to check it.  But I think it would really help us get a better handle on how things are going."
"41","  Okay, that would be great.  You can put it in a little log and then do you know how to use our online system, so you can send me your numbers?"
"42","  Okay, that is okay, yeah.  When we increase the medication, you can start sending those to me.  I mean, then, and I am okay.  So that I think is where we should start, I think we should check a few labs too, you know, some blood work to check in on you know, your organ function, your liver, your kidneys, your blood counts, and look at your lipids, your cholesterol, you know, those are all things that are affected by diabetes and just good to check here and there.  It looks like we have not done them, checked in on them on you for a while."
"43","  We will do all of that if you are okay with it."
"44","  Okay, okay.  I appreciate it.  Okay.  And then, in terms of your, your feeling tired all the time, tell me about how you have been sleeping?"
"45","  Okay, yeah.  How many times in the night are you going to the bathroom?"
"46","  Okay.  Yeah, that sounds that probably is not very nice to get good sleep in between that.  Yeah, okay.  I am going to ask you a couple of questions just about your urination that will help me figure out if, you know, you have something going on that we could treat and help you sleep better and not go to the bathroom all the time?  Do you feel like you have problems with your urine stream?  It is not as strong as it used to be or you have to start and stop."
"47","  Are you having any burning when you go to the bathroom?"
"48","  Okay.  No pain?"
"49","  Okay. Any..."
"50","  Okay.  And well, that was probably from your sugars being high.  I asked about you know, your urine stream not being as strong as it used to be because sometimes as men age, you can get something called, you can get problems with your prostate that are treatable.  We can treat it with a medication and that can be a reason why you go to the bathroom a lot at night too."
"51","  Yeah.  There is, there is a pill medication that we have to treat that.  Um, so I think for now it, it sounds like this is probably related to your diabetes.  But if things do not get better once we have got your diabetes under better control, then we could find that medication."
"52","  And do you have anyone that sleeps in the same room as you and knows whether you snore?"
"53","  Yeah, hmm.  Does she ever say that you pause breathing when you are, you are sleeping or snoring?  May..."
"54","  Okay, all right.  And, do you ever wake up with a headache in the morning?"
"55","  Okay, okay.  Another thing that makes me think about, you know, is sleep apnea if you have heard of it, that is when you know we snore a lot and then have these pauses in our breathing while we are sleeping."
"56","  And that can make you really tired during the day and wake up with a headache, you snore, so maybe tell, tell the Mrs. to keep an eye out for if you are doing that.  She would likely notice while you are sleeping."
"57","  Yeah.  If you are interested, you know, if she thinks there might be something that is happening or you are snoring a lot, we could do what is called a sleep study, which is where you kind of use this device at night.  They send it to your house to see if this is going on."
"58","  Yeah."
"59","  Exactly.  Yeah, just something to keep on the radar while we are, we are keeping an eye on things.  Okay, I am just looking at your chart here to make sure I am not missing anything and looks like you had trouble, trouble standing."
"60","  Okay.  In the legs and your arms, both?"
"61","  Okay.  Both of the legs or just one?"
"62","  Okay, okay.  And this feels brand new to you, have you had this before?"
"63","  And any injuries to your legs in the past?"
"64","  Any family history of anything similar?"
"65","  Okay.  Those are sometimes things that can happen when, when you live with diabetes, you can get some tingling and burning in your feet and things like that.  So, just things that I am, you know, thinking about as you tell me and okay, and while you know, I think the next thing to do would be you know, for me to examine you, which we are not doing here today to take a look at your legs.  And we will do this lab work and get your diabetes a little better under control, and then, we will go from there.  Did you have any other questions for me right now?"
"66","  Okay, excellent.  Well, we will work on getting those things done and then how about you come back and see me, you know, in about two weeks.  Those labs will be done and, and there we have been on your increased diabetes medication, the metformin for a little bit and we will talk again, do you think that would work for you?"
"67","  Okay.  Well, it was really great to meet you and thanks for coming in."
"68","  Yeah, have a good day."
"69","  I think you can sign off the Zoom call now."
