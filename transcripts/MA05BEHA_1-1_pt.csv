"1","  Hello."
"2","  Yeah, who is that?  I see your name is Jordan Potash. Is that right?"
"3","  Potash, okay."
"4","  You too.  How are you doing today?"
"5","  Great, well, thanks.  I appreciate that."
"6","  Just Freddie is great, yeah.  Mr. Jones, you got half of the world in front of you.  So yeah, Freddie is just fine."
"7","  Well, I know I am supposed to take care of my health, I have got diabetes and I am suppose to check in every, you know, four to six months or so, and for the last year or so, I haven't been and figured I want to take care of my health.  So, I better come in and get checked out, so here I am."
"8","  Yeah, pretty much everyday.  I miss a day every once in a while, maybe every couple of weeks or so, but pretty much get it on a regular basis."
"9","  Maybe every couple of weeks or so, maybe."
"10","  That is the way things go sometimes."
"11","  I think it was two of the metformin before, but then, last time they changed, it is just one 2000, what do you call them milligrams."
"12","  And the glipizide is, I think 10, yeah 10 milligrams."
"13","  Yeah, I do both in the morning now."
"14","  Yeah, I guess so.  It seems to work out, yeah."
"15","  I can do the other tests and things to when I need to."
"16","  Checking the glucose yeah today, it was 200, I guess."
"17","  A couple of times a week."
"18","  Yeah, I usually take in the morning before I get started, hmm."
"19","  Oh, no, I got plenty of the supplies.  I just, it just takes a lot of energy and that is the main thing that I am lacking these days.  I just got no energy.  I am just constantly tired, and so, I am looking for a way to bring my energy level up.  I got three grandkids to keep track of and it is kind of hard work sometimes running after them, and so, I don't want to be asleep, you know, when they grow up and wake up and find out that they are adults and I missed it."
"20","  That is, that is yeah, I would say that is my biggest concern."
"21","  I feel more like it gradually came on."
"22","  With this, it was not like a serious event or something that changed everything."
"23","  Oh, I don't know.  I think it is just kind of a gradual thing that has been going on and I just have noticed it more, I guess this year that, well I was just about six months into the year now almost.  So, I do not know when I started noticed the most, but all I know is that I feel more and more tired."
"24","  Great, that sounds good to me."
"25","  Yeah, yeah.  Gotta it is like herding cats, they say."
"26","  Oh, I would say it is an all day long thing.  I find myself dozing off at work sometimes or just can't concentrate when I get home and after dinner, I'll just zone out instead of playing with the grandkids.  Anyway, it is an all day long."
"27","  Yeah, it is kind of hard to stand for long periods of time.  I am supposed to get more exercise, and so, I have been doing more, well, I have been doing some walking once in a while, like a couple of times a week, maybe get out a while, depending on the weather, you know, I was like ________."
"28","  So, I am trying to be more active, I guess, but it is hard sometimes when feet and legs hurt and you are just tired."
"29","  I think it is more just a fatigue of it. Just they don't want to go any farther, (laughs), you are here that is all."
"30","  Yeah, kind of, it just comes and goes, so I don't know what causes it."
"31","  I don’t like my feet are asleep sometimes, yeah."
"32","  The last time, about a year so, it was like 7.4, I think was last number."
"33","  Yeah, yeah and we try and check those every."
"34","  Stay below 8, you know because I think that is good, that is good."
"35","  That is good."
"36","  Okay, that makes sense."
"37","  Sure."
"38","  I don't recall actually and I don't know.  It must have been sometime back.  I don't recall blood pressure being an issue."
"39","  The last provider I had was more concerned about whether or not I had fried chicken on the weekend than anything else, which is one of the reasons I decided to change providers, it is like, it is a family tradition.  If the whole plan gets together and what are we going to have, tofu sandwiches or something that is just, so anyway, yeah."
"40","  Maybe."
"41","  Sure, it is my wife is an incredible cook and maybe runs in the family now and the kids get involved.  Anyway, I appreciate your willingness to deal with me on that because my wife is a good cook, and I am not going to go in there and tell her to start cooking different stuff and so yeah..."
"42","  We have been together too long a time for me to start tampering in the kitchen at this point."
"43","  Yeah, I understand that.  Yeah, that is the talent sometimes."
"44","  Oh, I don't think so, no."
"45","  Okay."
"46","  It seems like a reasonable starting point, yeah."
"47","  Okay, well, this sounds good to me.  I appreciate Jordan."
"48","  Well, let's hope for that.  Yeah."
"49","  (Laughs).  All right and just kind of talks, just so I know, I have a little bit more of your history.  Have you ever been hospitalized?"
"50","  No."
"51","  No."
"52","  No."
"53","  It has been about eight years or more, I guess, yeah, in 2012, I guess is when they diagnosed me with diabetes, been a while and I guess just, just kind of become a habit dealing with it to, you know, taking the pills and doing the tests and stuff, you know."
"54","  I definitely don't want to go down that road.  Insulin is the last thing I want to get involved with."
"55","  That sounds reassuring.  I appreciate that, yeah."
"56","  No."
"57","  Yeah."
"58","  They are doing okay.  I have always got eye issues.  So, it _______ looks like a bird looking through the different lenses and trifocals on."
"59","  Oh, well, I was doing that about every year or so, but over the last year, everything is kind of been put on hold, so."
"60","  That is the main thing is who wants to go to a medical place during a medical emergency?  It just did not seem like a good idea."
"61","  Most of them are closed anyway and even if they were open, nobody is going there to work.  So, same just all over you go downtown, you go, well anyway, you know how it is."
"62","  Oh."
"63","  Sounds fantastic, you know.  It sounds as a good plan, thanks."
"64","  That would be good to do that lab.  I find myself getting up in the night many times to empty my bladder, so I understand that it is no joke content, ongoing problem anyway, yeah."
"65","  Not that I know of."
"66","  They haven't said anything about that.  Diabetes has been the main focus for most of my doctor visits over the last 10 years, I guess or eight years plus."
"67","  Sounds like a plan."
"68","  I don't think so, I don't know.  What do you do to check that?"
"69","  The Adam's apple."
"70","  Yeah, well, we can save that for another day, as you say."
"71","  Umm."
"72","  Okay, that is good to know, yeah."
"73","  No, no.  I, somebody, the best description I have heard is expensive urine."
"74","  (laughs) that is the best that I can't tell you how much I use that myself, that is Americans especially, but no, that is the best way to describe it.  So, I think there are certain things that can be useful, like I said, if we check on your labs and your vitamin D happened to be low or say that you had been inside for the last year and yet the sun had not touched your once, I would say that would be more of a concern, but now, otherwise for the most part, I do agree.  I think supplements can be very helpful when you have something that you know is low, but otherwise, just taking them is just expensive, making expensive urine.  (laughs), so now, I appreciate that and I, I never want to push more, more pills and meds on anyone than they need.  So, I like your approach to that."
"75","  That is fantastic.  I like your approach to it too."
"76","  I don’t know, yeah, that is not a big issue right now.  (Laughs), those portion sizes, we were talking about that before and that is one of the challenges."
"77","  Umm, maybe, I think I have maybe gained a little bit during the pandemic here, just not going anywhere or doing anything and it adds up after a while."
"78","  Okay, sounds good."
"79","  Umm, oh, well, yeah, but I didn't believe her.  I think she is making it up, but I think she is actually the one that snores, but I don't know.  How come, how can I tell what I do, I am asleep, but I guess I snore a little bit, yeah."
"80","  Hmm, not, particularly, no."
"81","  No."
"82","  Just run out of energy and like just, I don't know where or when, but it is gone."
"83","  Nope, so far (laughs) hopefully not."
"84","  Um, yeah, I am not too eager to get one of those machines.  I have heard about those."
"85","  I know that is, I have such a love hate with the media.  I know, I never want to _______ talks, when they first came out, they were very bulky, they have, they have made it, they have gotten a lot smaller last couple of years.  Because I think your complaint is the same as everyone's, so you don't want to go to bed with this giant machine on top of you.  So they have been, in the last couple of years especially, they have made a lot of strides in that.  I don't want you to stress or worry too much about having to use that unless we need it.  So, before we even get to that step, we have to go get a sleep study done, but..."
"86","  Okay."
"87","  Okay."
"88","  No, no."
"89","  Yeah, no, no (laughs)."
"90","  Special occasions, once in a while, a few times a year, maybe not a big deal."
"91","  Coffee, I suppose, that is about it.  I do like coffee ________ premature, yeah."
"92","  That is how I get my day going and a few cups along the way, but I don't know after a while I shift over to cola drinks that have caffeine in them too, and so sometimes, I will have that too."
"93","  I am trying tea, but it is like what is the point? Where are you?  No, I prefer coffee, thanks."
"94","  Hmm.  Usually, I have one at lunchtime and usually drink some with dinner, yeah, that is..."
"95","  Substance, so you mean like drugs and stuff, no, I don’t do this."
"96","  Not in particular, no."
"97","  Still crazy after all these years, as the song says, I don't know."
"98","  I love the same as I always am."
"99","  Well, I appreciate that, Jordan.  Thanks for your time today."
"100","  Not that I can think of, no thanks."
"101","  Yeah, I do accept."
"102","  Sounds great and I appreciate it."
"103","  You too Jordan.  Thanks a lot."
"104","  Sounds great."
"105","  Thanks."
