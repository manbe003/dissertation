"1","  Hi Freddie.  I think you're muted.  Try looking in the bottom left, there is a little microphone."
"2","  There you go.  Yeah."
"3","  No worries.  How are you doing today?"
"4","  Okay.  My name is Karina.  I'm a medical student.  I'll be chatting with you to see how you're doing."
"5","  And it looks to me like you came in just for a regular diabetes check today?"
"6","  Okay.  Was there anything else you wanted to chat about today?"
"7","  Okay, okay.  So it looks like in March you came in and we were able to take a look at your sugar level, hemoglobin A1c and it was at 7.9%."
"8","  Yes.  It's definitely higher."
"9","  Okay.  And what do you mean by being tired all the time?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Okay, okay.  And how long has that been going on for?"
"12","  Okay.  Does it seem to be getting worse?"
"13","  Yeah, okay."
"14","  Okay.  And do you feel like the energy, is it more of a like kind of body strain, kind of your body is just tired or how would you describe your lack of energy?"
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Okay.  And how are you sleeping at night?"
"17","  Okay.  Perfect.  How long do you sleep for at night?"
"18","  So we’re."
"19","  Perfect, okay.  And where do you work?"
"20","  Alright, sounds a little stressful."
"21","  Alright."
"22","  Yeah, okay, okay.  Alright.  So definitely one of the things that could be causing sort of just this increase in tiredness could be the diabetes as you kind of start increasing your numbers that can often lead to some tiredness.  There could be other reasons and that's why kind of I asked you about your sleep, and you seem to be sleeping okay.  Do you snore in your sleep?"
"23","  Wife hasn’t said anything?"
"24","  Okay, good."
"25","  Yeah, that's always good to know, because one of the other things that sometimes we're not aware of is the thing called obstructive sleep apnea and so basically while we're sleeping, we will suddenly stop breathing."
"26","  Yep, and it's very weird."
"27","  Mm hmm."
"28","  And some people don't even notice, they don’t realize their body will kind of just kick in and start breathing again.  But the things that they'll notice is they'll just feel much more tired throughout the day.  So that's similar to the symptoms that you are describing.  So that's snoring is one of the signs of it.  So if your wife complained, that's something that we could always get checked out, and apart from that, have you noticed any headaches at all?"
"29","  Alright.  Do you check your blood sugars?"
"30","  Alright.  And how those been doing?"
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Mm hmm.  Okay.  Then it might be a good idea to try and focus on that aspect of your health and see if we can get those numbers sort of back into the green level and see if that helps at all with your energy level."
"33","  How does that sound?"
"34","  Alright.  Have you been doing any exercise?"
"35","  Good.  How long are those walks?"
"36","  Okay.  And have you noticed any increased difficulty with those?"
"37","  Okay, perfect.  I do want to say that one of the things that we do try to encourage is for people to get around a 150 minutes a week of exercise where they are working sort of hard enough where it's hard to keep up a conversation."
"38","  That's alright."
"39","  We can definitely work up to it.  So maybe even if you keep doing your walks for two times a week, but instead of 15 minutes maybe stretching them to 30 minutes."
"40","  Yup, exactly."
"41","  Now that the sun is out it's perfect timing."
"42","  Awesome.  And then how is your diet doing?"
"43","  Okay."
"44","  I feel yeah.  You eat on the run."
"45","  Do you count your carbohydrates at all?"
"46","  Okay.  So that is definitely something we can help you with, because sometimes for people that have been diagnosed with diabetes, we have them meet up with a nutritionist to kind of learn about different diets that could make their diabetes worse or that could help improve it.  Have you had a chance to do that at all?"
"47","  Oh, okay.  We'll that's not good.  Not what we want."
"48","  Okay."
"49","  Do you think maybe having a referral to a nutritionist would be helpful for you to kind of get an idea of how to balance food?"
"50","  I totally understand.  I think the main thing is, we want you to be kind of conscious of what you're eating which I know is hard when you're super busy.  A nutritionist can actually be very helpful with that, especially if you meet with them with your wife.  That way your wife can be a part of that, part of it too and it helps you figure out what are some of the quick foods that you can grab on the go that would still be helpful for you as you're trying to kind of manage your diet to help decrease your sugar level during the -- for your diabetes.  Does that make sense?"
"51","  So, yeah, the whole point of it is to try and make it easier for you to manage your diabetes, not to add more things to your schedule."
"52","  Exactly.  So I'm just trying to make it as easy as possible for you."
"53","  And I think understanding a little bit in terms of the foods that would work best for you and your life and your schedule would be a great way to help manage the diabetes as well."
"54","  Okay?  Good, awesome.  I think especially since it's been a little while since the last time you've come in for a visit, we'd love to have you come in person at some point."
"55","  Yup, exactly because we want to make sure that we're checking everything else especially when someone has diabetes, there is a higher chance that having things like high blood pressure or high levels of, your cholesterol and so we want to make sure we keep tabs on all of those things as we gotta make sure that none of those are kind of being dysregulatedV or if they are that we have a plan to try and manage it.  We also want to make sure that we're screening you to make sure that your kidney is working fine, your liver is working fine.  We want to check you for cancer.  One of the big things that you care about your age is a colonoscopy.  Have you ever had one of those?"
"56","  Yup, exactly."
"57","  It doesn’t sound great."
"58","  I totally understand.  One of the, there's been a different thing called the ___ card that we use and so we mail that to you and you can put a little bit of poop on there and then you mail that back to us and we take a look at it and if we find any blood in it, then we ask you to do a colonoscopy.  If it all checks out clear and good, then we just ask you to do it again the following year.  How does that sound?"
"59","  Okay."
"60","  Okay."
"61","  No, well, you know, how like you wipe with a piece of toilet paper?"
"62","  Before we toss the toilet paper away, wipe that on the card and then throw it out."
"63","  Yeah."
"64","  No, no, no, no."
"65","  We don't need that much poop."
"66","  There you got.  And then we are also recommending a few vaccines for you since it's been a while, I think you haven’t gotten the flu vaccine and it's a little bit late now, but we want to make sure that you get it as we get closer to the fall.  And then another one that we recommend is the Pneumovax vaccine, which is to help prevent pneumonia. "
"67","  Yeah."
"68","  And then the other thing of course as we all know, we have the COVID vaccine.  Have you been able to get that one?"
"69","  Yup, exactly and there's three different kinds."
"70","  Yup, exactly."
"71","  Yeah, the Moderna and the Pfizer require two shots."
"72","  Yup."
"73","  Okay, perfect.  Okay, so I think those were the main things I wanted to cover.  I also wanted to make sure are you taking any medications right now?"
"74","  Alright.  And how much of the metformin are you taking?"
"75","  Once a day or twice a day?"
"76","  Okay and what about the glipizide?"
"77","  Perfect.  The other thing that we can do to try and help control your sugar levels apart from the trying to increase your exercise and maybe talking to a nutritionist about your food, is increase your metformin a little."
"78","  So increasing, did you have any side effects when you first started the metformin?"
"79","  No worry.  So for metformin usually the main side effect that people talk about is a little bit of a GI upset."
"80","  Yes, exactly.  And so that will happen maybe the first day or two that you take it and usually your body adjusts pretty well to it quickly."
"81","  Yes, exactly."
"82","  Perfect."
"83","  Alright.  So we can also consider increasing that as another possibility."
"84","  Alright, perfect.  So just to make sure, I covered, we covered a lot of stuff today."
"85","  Oh, yeah, definitely.  So in terms of your diabetes, number one, your hemoglobin A1c level has increased to 7.9% and that tracks pretty well with this sugar level that you've been taking at home.  So the plan for that is to try and decrease that using three different methods.  One, we're going to increase your metformin, okay?  So instead of taking 500 mg twice a day, we'll take 1000 mg twice a day."
"86","  Yes, okay?"
"87","  And the reason I'm doing that for metformin is that there is no danger of it causing you to have low blood sugar."
"88","  It’s a very safe medication."
"89","  Exactly.  Okay.  The second thing that we’re going to do is, have you talk to a nutritionist with your wife to think about the best ways to improve your diet and give you some quick snacks and stuff that you can eat on the go."
"90","  Okay?  And then number three is, we're going to try and increase the lengths of your walks that you take with your wife from 15 minutes to 30 minutes."
"91","  Sounds good?  Perfect."
"92","  Yeah, I totally understand."
"93","  Yeah, you did tell me about your tired, your, yes, and so in terms of your fatigue, I want you to kind of continue to monitor that, especially as we implement these new changes and see if there's any improvement with these new changes that we’re making because I want you to make a followup appointment within the next month.  That way you can come in and we can get those labs done that we talked about."
"94","  In that way if we're not seeing any changes in your fatigue, we can do additional workup for that."
"95","  Okay?  And then last thing is don't forget your vaccine, the Pneumovax vaccine and the shingles vaccine and we will send you the card to send in your sample for, to check for colon cancer."
"96","  Alright?  Does that all make sense? "
"97","  Any questions?"
"98","  Okay.  Well it's great to meet you.  I hope I was of help."
"99","  Nice to meet you too and then see you in a month."
"100","  Perfect, bye."
