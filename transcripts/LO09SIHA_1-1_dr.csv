"1","  Hello, Mr. ____.  I think you’re still muted there.  Do you see how to turn on your microphone?  It should be a little red.  There you go."
"2","  Hi."
"3","  Hello, my name is Valerie, I am a student doctor here to talk with you today, how you’re doing?"
"4","  Okay.  Real quick, can I ask what you prefer to be called by?"
"5","  Freddy, works, okay, great.  All right, Freddy, so you’re feeling a little tired, I saw you’re here for to talk about diabetes and you’ve also been having some fatigue.  So, why don’t you tell me what’s been going on since you are last seen for your diabetes?"
"6","  Okay.  Are you having any chest pain?"
"7","  How about shortness of breath?"
"8","  Okay, good, glad to hear that.  So, when you talked about feeling more tired more frequently, are you getting enough sleep, how you’re sleeping?"
"9","  Okay, okay.  Do you wake up feeling still tired?"
"10","  Okay, you’re taking a nap in the afternoon?"
"11","  No time for that huh?"
"12","  Okay, okay still working, all right.  Well, tell me how your, so this could be related to the things you’ve already got going on diabetes and your hyperlipidemia, so let’s talk about how that’s going, are you taking your diabetes medications?"
"13","  Okay.  Are you measuring your blood sugar huh?"
"14","  Okay and how the measurements been?"
"15","  Okay.  When you woke up before you ate breakfast?"
"16","  Okay and tell me about your diet these days?"
"17","  Okay, that all sounds pretty tasty."
"18","  But has your doctors talked to you in the past about maybe some healthier options?"
"19","  Yeah."
"20","  Okay.  Is that if we’ve had some resources for you to offer that support, is that something you would be interested in?"
"21","  Okay, I bet you could get your wife involved too and you could make it a team effort."
"22","  Well, I think right now I am seeing some records with your hemoglobin A1c you know that’s a record of your what your blood sugar does to your red blood cells over time.  So, it sort of the long-term record, right and it’s been kind of progressively getting worse over the last couple of years.  So, what that means is your diabetes we’re not being able to manage it very well with your current medications and your current diet.  So, we’re going to have to figure out how to make changes and I think you know starting with some resources on how to improve your diet would be good, but as you progressed into that, we also probably need to make some changes to your medication and what I am going to recommend is that we add, in fact I am not going to recommend we add because I know you’ve already taken two a day.  Instead of the glipizide, I think we should put you on an SGLT2 inhibitor and those have been shown to really help people a lot with blood sugar issue.  So, if we do that with the metformin, let’s see what your blood sugar looks like and then making some dietary changes if we can get your blood sugar back under control, I think that’s going to really help you with your feeling of tiredness.  I think it’s possible that a lot of this fatigue is because your body isn’t able to deal with the blood sugar and you are not, basically you are not getting the energy you need because it’s not being able to take it out of your blood right now."
"23","  So, we can use some medications and some better diet to help you process your blood sugar better, I think your energy is going to feel a lot better too."
"24","  Is that sound like a reasonable plan?"
"25","  Absolutely."
"26","  Yeah, so I think what we’ll do is we’ll have the doctor write a prescription for the SGLT2 inhibitor and you will start taking that medication with the metformin and then I am going to provide you some resources and how the diet coach, nutrition coach contact you and you and your wife can both work with the coach to talk about what changes will work for you guys, okay."
"27","  So, that will be a partnership between the both of you and the nutritionist."
"28","  That’s right."
"29","  Does that sound like a good plan to you?"
"30","  Yeah, well we don’t want that to happen and I think if we make these changes and then maybe we’ll follow up in about a month.  You keep monitoring your blood sugar, start taking this new medication and we’ll follow up in four weeks to see where you blood sugars at and how you’re feeling, okay."
"31","  All right.  Well, Freddy any other questions today, any other concerns?"
"32","  It is."
"33","  It is a challenge and so we want to support you know we’re not going to leave you out to die, we want to support you medically as well as we can and with the resources that we can in terms of some coaching to help you make some of those changes that work for you and keep you living a healthy long life."
"34","  All right, okay.  So, let’s find a followup in four weeks, okay."
"35","  All right, all right.  Well, thank you so much, Freddy."
"36","  Okay."
"37","  Bye, bye."
