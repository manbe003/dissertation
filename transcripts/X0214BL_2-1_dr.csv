"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Is it Tom?"
"3","  I believe so.  Yeah, how is it going?"
"4","  Yeah, by the way, I am Erica, I am a med student and we’ll just be chatting a little bit about why you are here.  Oh, I see from your chart here that someone wrote down COVID assessment, it seems like you’ve been having some COVID symptoms.  You want to tell me about that?"
"5","  Uh huh."
"6","  Yeah."
"7","  Yeah, well I am glad that you, you know found some time during your day to come meet and hopefully get this resolved for you.  So, I am sure you’ve heard a lot about the different symptoms COVID has on TV and social medial and stuff like that, but you let me know if you have any of these, I am just kind of go through a checklist in my head okay?"
"8","  You said you kind of feel hot, like fever, feverish?"
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Okay and that’s totally fine.  Any chills?"
"11","  Yeah.  Any shortness of breath?"
"12","  No.  When you take a deep breath does that kind of feel the same as before?"
"13","  Has your nose always been like that or is this something new?"
"14","  Yeah, so I know that like having any sort of like cold symptoms during this time is like very anxiety inducing."
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Oh, yeah, I know that’s okay.  Yeah, so it sounds like you’ve just been not feeling like yourself.  Would you be interested in a COVID test today?"
"17","  Yeah."
"18","  Yeah.  Tell me again when did all this just uncomfortableness like start for you, did they just start this morning or?"
"19","  Monday, okay."
"20","  Yeah, were you out and about I am sure during construction you have to be out on your site and be with people and stuff like that, is anyone else…"
"21","  Right, right.  Is anyone sick at work or at home?"
"22","  Okay, okay and since you said it has been kind of a while since you’ve come to visit the doctors and we don’t really have much information about you here in your chart, what has kind of happened in the past 10 years health wise? "
"23","  Or what changes, I asked kind of a really long question."
"24","  Okay, okay."
"25","  Yeah and so what med…are you taking any medication right now?"
"26","  Yeah, do you take that every day and every night?"
"27","  Do you take the DayQuil and NyQuil every day and every night?"
"28","  Okay, okay for the three or four days, not for the past 10 years.  I just want to make sure. "
"29","  Okay, okay and I just wanted to ask are you a smoker?"
"30","  Okay, any drugs?"
"31","  Okay, what about alcohol?"
"32","  Okay, how much do you drink?"
"33","  Okay, like two or three?"
"34","  Okay.  Let’s see.  When you last visited the doctor last time did they say anything about your health that they kind of want to follow you closely on or?"
"35","  Like blood pressure stuff, blood sugar, any labs that seem abnormal?"
"36","  Okay, okay.  Well I would definitely want to…."
"37","  Yeah, the telehealth thing is a little bit new here but let me go and ask my team and see if we can get the COVID test that you kind of requested and see if we can kind of cross one thing off your mind.  But I just wanted to check again that you don’t have like shortness of breath when you walk around you don’t, you are not like completely out of breath?"
"38","  Okay, okay, alright.  What questions do you have for me?"
"39","  Oh that’s okay."
"40","  Oh, there usually should be like a restart later or like cancel."
"41","  Is there like a drop box menu?"
"42","  Okay.  "
"43","  Yeah."
"44","  Oh no worries.  Yeah, is there any other last-minute questions you have before I go and kind of report this to my team?"
"45","  Yeah, so this is honestly my very first time doing an appointment over telehealth and so we would definitely want to see you and you know check you out in person if that’s something that you want to do and I think during that time I would like to look at your blood pressure and maybe take some labs and just see how you’re doing overall and then maybe we could chat a little bit more on what we should be doing going forward with your health.  Does that kind of sound okay? "
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Okay, great.  Yeah, let me raise my hand here again.  Sorry, this is taking some time."
