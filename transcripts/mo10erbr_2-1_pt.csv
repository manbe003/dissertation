"1","  I am doing fantastic."
"2","  You cannot?"
"3","  Okay, hold a second."
"4","  I am doing good.  How are you doing?"
"5","  Yes."
"6","  No, that’s primarily the reason that I am coming in today.  It has been about a year since I’ve been in and I normally try, you know, in the past, I’ve tried to come in every four to six months, so it’s been a year, so I feel I need a little checkup and just to make sure that everything is going well."
"7","  Just work, just being really busy."
"8","  Thus far it’s been going okay, but my, you know, I feel – I am probably more tired now than I have in the past, I need to take more rest breaks than normal and so that is a concern, I don’t know whether it is the diabetes, I am getting old.  It could be a combination of both."
"9","  Uh huh."
"10","  I would say probably in the last four months I’ve been noticing a little more fatigue than usual. "
"11","  Well, it varies depending on my activities for that particular day.  At work, I don’t do really strenuous work, it’s just that you know after about an hour or so I feel like I want to go take a nap, but I don’t because I am at work, and I you know after walking with my wife, she and I walk 10 to 15 minutes about twice a week and so after that, I am a little tired."
"12","  Uh huh."
"13","  No, no, none of that."
"14","  No."
"15","  Uh huh."
"16","  No, no."
"17","  Uh huh."
"18","  Uh huh."
"19","  Sure, uh huh."
"20","  Well about a year ago it was like 7.4, so if the labs I’ve taken today if they indicate 7.9, yes, they are going up a little."
"21","  Yes.  Uh huh."
"22","  My sugar this morning was 215."
"23","  That was before I had breakfast."
"24","  Yes, but it’s kind of creeping more and more into the yellow zone, so that’s another concern."
"25","  Yes.  Uh huh."
"26","  Fairly frequently, I may miss taking my medication maybe once every couple of weeks or something like that, but I try to stay on the regimen of taking it regularly."
"27","  I guess a few doses.  Uh huh."
"28","  I just notice that maybe every two weeks I may miss one dose during that period of time."
"29","  So it is kind of hard to say weekly.  I don’t miss it weekly, but maybe every two weeks and depends on you know what’s in my head and what I am trying, you know, having rush out to door to go to work or whatever I just may miss a dose then, but once every two weeks."
"30","  I think I’ve tolerated them fairly well."
"31","  No, when I first came in and diagnosed eight years ago, one of the things that I mentioned to my doctor at that time was that I had some tingling in my legs and but since I’ve been on medication that has gone away, so ___ if I don’t experience anything like that now."
"32","  No, no."
"33","  No, what is that?"
"34","  Uh huh."
"35","  Okay.  Uh huh."
"36","  Okay, okay."
"37","  Uh huh."
"38","  Uh huh."
"39","  Well I have noticed that I urinate more frequently now and so there are many questions that comes to my mind is that am I just getting old or what, you know, hahaha….I know that that’s a part of the process, but I do have more frequent urination."
"40","  No, it’s, I mean it is not like I pee like I was when I was eight years old, no, no, like a steady stream, so."
"41","  But no discomfort or anything like that."
"42","  No."
"43","  No, nothing like that."
"44","  Delicious.  Hahaha."
"45","  Well on a regular basis for breakfast I’ll have coffee with cream and sugar and then I’ll have eggs and hash browns with a little butter on the hash browns and then at lunch time because I work downtown I would run over to McDonald’s and grab a double cheese burger with fries and a soda."
"46","  And then in the evening my wife will on average will do steak and potatoes and with that I’ll have, in addition to that I’ll have a bowl of ice cream with that you know and then on the weekends she likes cooking fried chicken.  Hahaha…"
"47","  Yes….hahaha….____ really healthy but I."
"48","  Well, the only recommendation that I’ve received and this was from my previous provider is that he told me stop eating chicken, fried chicken."
"49","  That didn’t work and so I, for one thing I don’t cook, so you know my wife prepares the meals and she buys what she buys and I eat what she cooks and so that’s where I am.  Any suggestions or recommendations?"
"50","  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"51","  Uh huh."
"52","  Well, again because I don’t cook, I am, you know, I am challenged with integrating those items into my diet, but I could mention them to my wife, but again she cooks, I like her cooking and you know, don’t have much choice about it, but any other suggestions you may have."
"53","  Uh huh."
"54","  Uhhhh.  That’s possible.  I will take that into consideration, yes.  Uh huh."
"55","  Okay, okay."
"56","  Well I am not interested in insulin, you know, if I can continue on my current medication that I have now I am pleased with that.  The insulin it’s kind of one of those stage in life that you feel that is going to require a major change in my lifestyle and right now still I am currently working and so that would, if at all possible stay with my current medication."
"57","  Uh huh."
"58","  Aging."
"59","  No, again I enjoy eating, I mean like most people do and probably I could have a serious conversation with my wife in regard to intergrading or implementing more fruits and vegetables and grains into our meals, but again she is the cook and you know I have the cook as I have the house, so you know, so….hahaha."
"60","  Even if it is killing me slowly."
"61","  Sure."
"62","  Okay, what is the purpose of the glipizide?"
"63","  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"64","  Okay."
"65","  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"66","  Okay."
"67","  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"68","  Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Uh huh."
"69","  Well, I think what we’ve discussed in terms of you know possibly changing my diet or by you know having more fruits and vegetables included and grains and I think the idea of having my wife you know give the same message that may help in the future."
"70","  Okay.  Uh huh."
"71","  Uh huh."
"72","  Some time in the future.  What would you recommend, you said that was 2011 was the last time I had one and…"
"73","  Talked about alright, I don’t recall having one so."
"74","  I heard that it’s not a pleasant experience."
"75","  Hahaha."
"76","  Sure."
"77","  Sure.  Uh huh, uh huh."
"78","  Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."
"79","  Okay, okay."
"80","  That sounds good, that sounds good.  I know that colonoscopy is a necessary evil, so I’ll just bit my teeth and bear with it."
"81","  Hahaha…You haven’t had one right."
"82","  Okay."
"83","  Okay, I’ll leave that alone, I was going to say when your time comes you reflect in your mind, Freddie told me about this."
"84","  Okay, fine."
"85","  Well, it was a pleasure meeting you as well, okay and look forward to meeting with you in the future."
"86","  Okay."
"87","  Bye-bye.  We are both being technically challenged right."
"88","  You are saying, oh, yes the leave okay, I see it, okay, leave the screen okay."
"89","  Leave the meeting.  Okay."
