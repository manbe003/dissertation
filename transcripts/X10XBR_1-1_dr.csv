"1","  Hi, Freddie, are you there, okay.  Hi, Freddie.  Hello, can you hear me?  I think you are muted.  Hi, Freddie. I think you are muted if you go to the left lower button on your screen there should be a little microphone if you click that should unmute you, Hello."
"2","  Hi Freddie, I think your video is off."
"3","  Okay, you are unmuted.  That is perfect.  But your video is off, so you want to click the button right next to the mute button.  Should turn your video back on.  Thank you.  That is perfect.  Hi, I am Leah."
"4","  I am here to see you today.  I heard that you wanted to talk about your diabetes and have like a routine check in."
"5","  Alright, computers are hard."
"6","  Awesome.  No worries about being late, I mean, things happen, life happens.  But how have you been doing in the year since?"
"7","  Hmm, okay, well, I definitely want to talk about the fatigue, but how about we start with the diabetes a little bit when I ask you a few questions about how that is going and then we will concentrate on the fatigue after that."
"8","  So for your diabetes, I see that you are taking metformin and glipizide, is that true?"
"9","  Okay.  And you have not had any issues with the medications you have been able to take them?"
"10","  Okay, yeah."
"11","  Alright.  And have you been checking your blood sugars at home? How is that going?"
"12","  215 okay, and is that kind of about where you are normally or is that a little higher,"
"13","  200, okay, "
"14","  Okay.  And how do you feel like diet is going? Are you trying to eat healthy?"
"15","  That is awesome, okay, so getting like a good amount of vegetables and fiber and all that."
"16","  Okay, hahaha, awesome, a good effort.  And how about exercise? How is exercise going for you?"
"17","  Awesome, okay.  And then I am just going to ask you some questions.  Have you experienced any dizziness recently?"
"18","  No dizziness, okay.  Any headaches?"
"19","  Any numbness or tingling in your fingers or toes?"
"20","  Okay.  I only ask that because sometimes when diabetes gets out of control, it can cause different symptoms and so I just want to make sure you are not experiencing those symptoms because if you are, then we ought to get a better control over your blood sugars"
"21","  Awesome, that is good to hear.  And when was your last eye exam for diabetes?"
"22","  Alright, okay, good.  And no vision changes, right?"
"23","  So the one thing I want to do for the diabetes is every three months you are supposed to get a foot exam just to make sure that because one side effect from diabetes is that could cause tingling and numbness, it can cause nerve changes in your hands and feet and so one thing we want to make sure is that you are still having sensation in your feet, so if it is okay with you, I am going to have you come back in, in a couple weeks and do a foot exam for you, a diabetic foot exam, are you interested in that?"
"24","  Okay.  So that is one thing."
"25","  Absolutely.  Yeah.  We can definitely make that work.  And then I heard so let us talk about the fatigue now.  You said you are feeling really tired."
"26","  Okay.  And I heard that started about six months ago.  Is that true?"
"27","  Okay, okay.  And it sounds like you are having, according to what the nurse wrote down, you are also having some trouble standing for over a couple hours?"
"28","  Hmm hmm.  What happens if you stand for too long?"
"29","  Okay.  What kind of pain is it? When you say sore, is it like a stabby pain? Is it an achy pain? Is it numbness?"
"30","  Achy pain.  Does it feel like your legs have fallen asleep or is it more of a muscle ache?"
"31","  Okay.  What do you do when your legs start to get tired when you sit down? Does it help with the pain?"
"32","  Okay. okay, and when you say leg pain, is it mainly in the calf area, the thigh area? Is it in your joints?"
"33","  So moving around seems to help with the fatigue."
"34","  Does moving around help with the fatigue and the pain?"
"35","  Okay, have you had any shortness of breath recently or chest pain? "
"36","  Okay.  Have you noticed any blood in your stool or blood in your urine?"
"37","  How about any weight loss in the past couple of months?"
"38","  Hahaha, okay, okay.  When you touch your legs, do they seem swollen?"
"39","  Are they cold to the touch or warm to touch?"
"40","  Warm, okay."
"41","  Hmm, okay, okay.  And you said that the fatigue does not really happen until kind of midafternoon, like you are not fatigued in the morning at all?"
"42","  Okay.  Well, for the fatigue, I am wondering about a couple different things.  One of them could be that you are having a deficiency in iron, like an iron deficiency anemia or just not getting enough of certain things in your diet and so if you are interested in doing this, like I would love for you to come in at the same time as you are getting your foot exam we can also get a couple labs and check, we can check your blood sugar, we can check your iron, we can check some other vitamins as well, just to see if you have got some kind of deficiency going on and if that is the case, that is a very easy fix.  What do you think of that?"
"43","  Yeah, absolutely. And that is true, yes, hahaha, but sometimes we can have bleeds going on in our bodies that we do not know about and given your age "
"44","  yeah so and given your age that you are in your 60s, like that can be a little more common.  I just want to be cautious and make sure that we are catching something if it is happening.  Does that make sense? okay.  But nothing to be worried about at this point like you are not having any red flags, symptoms for malignancy like you do not have any weight loss, you do not have any blood in your stool or anything like that, so I am not super worried, but I just want to make sure that we are not missing like an anemia, okay."
"45","  Anemia sorry.  Anemia is the iron deficiency, yeah, okay, okay. so that is what we are going to do for the fatigue and then for your diabetes, I am a little concerned that so the blood sugar, we like to keep it kind of in the 130s to 150s range and you are kind of hovering around the 200.  So I am wondering if we can also draw A1c while you are there, it is all just one blood draw and do you know what an A1c is?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Yeah absolutely.   Since you have not been in, in a year, I just want to get another one and just make sure we are still on the right track."
"48","  Cool.  So just to summarize, you are going to come in sometime next weekend, we are going to get a foot exam done.  We are going to get some iron studies and we are going to get an A1c as well.  Is that okay with you?"
"49","  Yeah.  We will just try to get all done in one go, and if the A1c is high, I do want to see you back in a couple weeks, because if it is high, we are going to think about changing your medications, okay?"
"50","  Okay, sounds good.  Do you have any more questions for me or anything else that you want to talk about?"
"51","  No. No. I  am not concerned at this point.  Like I know the fatigue is a little bit worrying for you for sure because you have to go to work and you have to do a lot of things, but I am not worried about cancer or anything worrying like that, you do not have any weight loss, you do not have any of the red flag symptoms"
"52","  Well, why did you ask that? I would not want you to go back and be worried about it, but I am definitely not super concerned. I just want it to be 100% sure."
"53","  Okay, alright.  Do you want to follow up again on your fatigue after the labs or do you want me to just call you with the results and we can talk through that together?"
"54","  Alright.  That sounds good.  And we will come up with a plan going forward from there."
"55","   Okay.  Great. Nice meeting you."
"56","  So there is a button on the bottom right, it should be red and it states leave and you can just click that."
"57","  Alright."
"58","  Hmm."
