"4","  Awesome, that's great.  Well, thank you for coming in Freddie.  Can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?"
"5","  Yeah, yeah."
"6","  Yeah, well I understand it can, it can be hard to make changes in one's lifestyle, especially with diagnosis like diabetes and other chronic health issues.  Could you talk more about when you were diagnosed with diabetes?"
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Yeah, well it seems like it's been a long journey for you, with a lot of considerations along the way.  Just to make sure everything I need, I know you mentioned you have some tingling in your legs, well any other symptoms you felt throughout these eight years associated with the diabetes?"
"9","  Yeah.  And do you know what meds you're on?"
"10","  Okay.  Have you ever had any side effects from the medications?"
"11","  Okay, nothing you noticed, that's great.  And I feel and as you mentioned you are worried about the numbers are climbing, even though you're not really feeling any symptoms?"
"12","  Yeah."
"13","  Yeah.  Was that, has that been like a gradual thing, like feeling that you have less energy over the past eight years?"
"14","  Yeah.  And how do you describe your diet has been over the span of months that you've been feeling more tired?"
"15","  Yeah, awesome.  Thank you for that very thorough explanation about you, you have throughout the week.  I guess, also going back to your prior visit, I mean, I heard that your prior provider mentioned that you guys wanted to talk about some changes in your diet.  Could we speak more about like what changes you guys were talking about? "
"16","  Yeah."
"17","  Yeah, yeah.  I can understand, that must have been frustrating for you."
"18","  Yeah, sorry, you got cut off a bit there, but I think what you're saying that it's been a year?"
"19","  Yeah.  Oh, but I'm glad to hear you.  Yeah, well, yeah, we're glad that you're here.  I think it is like, food is an important part of everyone's life and it's hard to like change something that you've been following for so many years.  I think we can definitely sit down and have a conversation about your diet and see how we can make it the best or make it the best for you in terms of not only your health, but also like, you know, what do you want to eat every day as well.  So, I think that is a discussion that we can have.  Would you be comfortable having a discussion with a nutritionist or someone who is, you know, who can help you with that?"
"20","  Yeah.  I think that's very understandable."
"21","  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we can definitely have your wife in that conversation and I think we can set goals at the beginning like hey, like I still want to enjoy my food, I want to have food that my entire family can eat as well, like we can set those goals and then come out with a diet that aligns with those goals.  As well as of course importantly making sure that it's going to help manage your diabetes as well.  Yeah, awesome.  So we can set that up for a visit coming up.  And so just like a couple of other questions I had for you were like, with your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with something other than diabetes in the past?"
"22","  Okay.  Anything, any doctor ever told you, you have high blood pressure or anything?"
"23","  Alright, yeah.  That's great, thank you for that.  Have you ever had any major surgeries or trauma in the past?"
"24","  No, alright.  Okay.  So, anyone every told you, you have high cholesterol?"
"25","  Okay.  Alright, yeah, we're going to go without your chart as well.  I just wanted to get your, just to hear, have you ever been told that and then talking more about like more personal lifestyle or personal lifestyle factors, have you, if you drink alcohol do you know, do you remember how many times you drink alcohol in a week or?"
"26","  Okay.  And have you ever smoked tobacco or if you are a tobacco user do you remember how many times?"
"27","  Okay, great.  And then do you know if you're up-to-date with your immunizations?"
"28","  Yeah, awesome.  Alright.  So I just have some housekeeping questions that I want to get in order, but yeah, it seems to me that, you know, your diabetes is decent like very, like pretty well controlled with the medications.  I understand you have been feeling more tired the past few months, and I think we can of course run some tests, see what your blood glucose level is at, what your A1c is at and just see where all your, where your, see where your blood count is and everything.  And we can definitely sit down with a nutritionist and figure out how we can make, how we can have like, make sure that, how we can have a diet that helps with your diabetes and also works with you and with that extra information we can think about next steps as well.  We'll make sure that, to help alleviate the tiredness and fatigue you've been feeling."
"29","  Awesome.  Is there any other questions that you have for me?"
"30","  Yeah, I thinkâ€¦"
"31","  I mean, how many times do you think you've been peeing per day?"
"32","  Okay.  Yeah, I think that is more times than I think than a person tends to pee per day or per night and do you feel like that's been impacting your daily life?"
"33","  Yeah.  So I think, yeah that's thing you brought up, I think we can definitely get urinalysis just to see what's going on and we can also like, based on that results we can see if we need to adjust any of your medications to make sure you don't have to like, you know, alleviate the number of times you are going to the bathroom per day and night. "
"34","  Yeah, okay anything else you want to talk about? "
"35","  Okay.  I've never heard that joke before."
