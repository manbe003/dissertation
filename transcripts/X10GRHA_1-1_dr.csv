"1","  Hi Tom, I am Molly Cole.  I am a fourth-year medical student, Tom."
"2","  How are you doing?"
"3","  I am sorry to hear that.  Tell me what is going on?"
"4","  Well, I am glad.  I think that you know, COVID is a very common concern that is going around right now, and it can definitely become serious if, if for some people and so I am really glad that you just came in and talked to me and we will see, we will see what is going on.  Tell me when did your symptoms first start?"
"5","  Okay, and what are you experiencing?  What makes you feel like this is some sort of cold or even COVID?"
"6","  Yeah, you are definitely coughing a lot.  When did that start?"
"7","  About the same time?  Do you feel like it has changed any over the period of time you have had it?"
"8","  About the same, getting any worse or better?"
"9","  I see.  Well, that is definitely, that is typically what a lot of colds do.  My only concern is I, I do feel like it is possible that you could have caught COVID.  So, I want to ask a couple of more questions.  Would that be alright with you?"
"10","  Hm and I reviewed kind of the history that you gave on the chart, but I want to make sure that we match it up, so some of these might be repeat questions that you have answered in your writing like we like to do, but are you having any change in smell at all like loss of smell."
"11","  Okay, and any you said you had kind of feeling warm, have you checked your temperature and what has it been?"
"12","  Okay.  Do you have and you said I think it was your, your partner or family member had been a little bit more concerned.  Do you know why they were specifically more concerned about your cough?"
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  I understand.  Do you have any history of other medical problems?"
"15","  Any breathing issues in the past that you have ever had, ever had in the past?"
"16","  Nope, none of that okay.  And how is your activity level right now?  I know you said you were feeling more tired.  How far do you feel like you would be able to walk and get up and walk?"
"17","  And are you doing that like, are you working today or did you work in the past?"
"18","  Okay.  Well, that is a good job for you, for you to be doing that construction and do you feel like you are still able to do all the jobs that you typically do while you have been kind of feeling icky?"
"19","  Yeah, any issues with your breathing?"
"20","  Okay, well.  And any chest pain at all?"
"21","  Okay, good.  I am glad to hear it.  And any other, any other major changes like abdominal pain, diarrhea?"
"22","  You do regularly or during this time."
"23","  Okay, okay.  Have you ever seen a doctor for that before?"
"24","  Okay. Umm and any other, any other concerns that you have today that you wanted to address?  I forgot to ask that at the beginning."
"25","  Nope, just mainly.."
"26","  Yeah, those are good questions.  I mainly just wanted to see if you had any other concerns that I want that I should address in this visit.  I typically ask that because sometimes people come with a list of concerns that they have."
"27","  But I am glad to hear that there are not any other major issues that you are feeling.  I think the most concerning thing for me at the moment is the fact that you do have this cough, which in my opinion it could be COVID.  It does not seem right now that you have a really, if it was COVID, it does not seem we put people in kind of mild, moderate and severe categories for COVID, and you see more in the milder category."
"28","  We do not know that."
"29","  No, so I am not sure because in order to know for sure, I would have to test you.  We would have to test you."
"30","  What was that?"
"31","  If you are interested in testing then."
"32","  I think that is it."
"33","  I hear you, I hear you.  You know, I think the reasoning for that, that we like to test people is because we do not want to give it to someone else, who could get a more severe form of COVID.  So, I think what I would recommend is that we could one send a swab to your house, so there is a delivery system that we can send testing kit to your house, so you do not even have to go out and get it to you, so you can take that swab and a lot of the times they stick it up your nose and test you.  It is not very comfortable.  I will warn you on that, but it is a whole lot more comfortable than having a severe form of COVID.  So that is one thing that I would say.  Do you have any questions about that?"
"34","  Great.  Yes, so we can do that the home kit, occasionally now they are doing drive through testing as well.  So if that is something that you would prefer, there is one right over at Harborview if that is similar to you, so you go drive up and they will swab you themselves, umm, that is also an option."
"35","  Yeah, you can message me through the MyChart System as well in which you would prefer."
"36","  I am, I want to say I am really reassured that you are able to talk to me, you are breathing pretty well, you do have a cough, but it sounds like you are really able to kind of do your normal activities, which is really reassuring and I am not, I am not at all at this moment concerned that you need to go to the emergency department or anything like that."
"37","  However, however, yes, I think that is very good.  However, if your symptoms were to change or to worsen, I would definitely want to know about it in which case, we would, we could potentially have you sent to the emergency department if your symptoms were to worsen.  So that means you are not feeling well, you are getting short of breath, you are having a harder time doing the things that you normally do.  How does that sound to you?  I know I just send a lot of information out of you."
"38","  Yes, and one, so that is great.  Thanks for repeating that back to me.  One other thing that I wanted to add is you can take Tylenol to help you feel better and kind of give you a little bit help with the fever if you have a fever and feeling warm.  You can also take Coricidin.  There is this particular kind called Coricidin HBP or Coricidin high blood pressure, which ignore that name.  Basically, it can help with, it is a cough suppressant, so it can help with that cough."
"39","  It can help with some of the icky feelings that you are having.  I mean that is just over-the-counter, but we could, we also have some kits that people can bring to people's houses, so you do not have to go out into the store and buy that."
"40","  I would, I would right because we are testing you for COVID, I would have you isolate in your house, umm, during that time we are testing if you are able to do that and stay away from people that test."
"41","  I hear you.  That is major, that would be an issue, umm."
"42","  And you are all outdoors, it sounds like."
"43","  Are you all outdoors?"
"44","  Is there any way that you were able, I can also write a doctor's note that states that you are unable to work for just the period of time that we are testing you, which would be typically we get the results back in 24-48 hours.  Would that be okay?"
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Okay, the reason why I am telling you this, the reason why we are worried about you potentially spreading COVID if you had COVID is because if you were to give it to someone else, who was, had respiratory illnesses themselves, such as just lung issues for breathing, they could potentially get a really severe form of COVID and they could end up in the hospital.  So you would not, so you could potentially get them sick and so that is the reason.  Even though you are feeling okay, you could potentially pass it on to someone else and so that is why we have people isolate for that period of time while they get tested.  If it is a negative test, it will be great.  You can go back to work, but if it is a positive test, then we would probably have you stay in for longer."
"47","  Um, that would probably work."
"48","  Yeah, okay.  Because I know it is important for you to get to work, so we will try to work that out with your schedule.  In the meantime, do wear your mask.  I think that this is lower suspicion that this could be COVID, but it is possible given that that is one of the things that is coming around."
"49","  Umm, I think it would be a good idea to maybe set up an appointment for later or when you have, since you have not had a chance to really see a doctor and you said you had this diarrhea and things like that, I am wondering would you at any point I know you are a hard worker and you are really busy, maybe in two weeks or three weeks, we could check in and see each other again, maybe over telemedicine."
"50","  Okay."
"51","  That sounds great.  Tom, thank you so much for chatting."
"52","  I hope you have a good rest of your day.  We will send that kit over for you for the testing and in the meantime, if you are feeling icky, just take one of the Coricidin and that should be helpful for you."
"53","  Nice to meet you.  Bye, bye."
