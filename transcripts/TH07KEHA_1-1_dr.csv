"2","  Hey, how you are doing?"
"3","  Doing pretty good.  My name is Lance.  I am a first year medical student and I am going to be working with you today.  I prefer to use he, him pronouns.  I see that you have Tom as your name.  Is that what you approve as we go by?"
"4","  Awesome.  Alright, Tom we will, tell me what's bringing you in today?"
"5","  Yeah, that's definitely understandable as we are in the time of COVID right now, so we are going to make sure that we are staying in safe and everything.  So, can you tell me a little bit more about the cold symptoms that you have been having?"
"6","  Okay, and with that low fever what would you say the average temperature has been?"
"7","  Okay, perfect.  And you mentioned cough, correct?"
"8","  Has that been like a productive cough?  Have you noticed any like sputum or new sputum?"
"9","  And can you like, is that, does it have a color or what is that like?"
"10","  Off white?  Okay, anything else with that?"
"11","  Alright.  And is that every single time you cough, every once in a while?"
"12","  Every time?  Alright.  Alright.  So you had a low grade fever.  You have a cough.  Have you had any other symptoms?"
"13","  Alright, so just those two for right now.  And you said that this has been going on for about a week, correct?"
"14","  Awesome.  So, I will make sure to have all those down to make sure that we can get the best care for you.  And, do you have any other things that you want to talk about today?"
"15","  Alright.  So, we will just focus all of our attention on this then.  So, when you noticed that it started about a week ago?  Were you around any other sick individuals that you know of?"
"16","  Alright.  And, do you currently work?"
"17","  Alright.  What you do for work?"
"18","  Okay, cool.  So, you are probably around new people every once in a while at work, right?"
"19","  Yeah.  Do you know if any of those people that you have been working with have been calling out of work sick lately or have you not really noticed any of that?"
"20","  Okay, alright, and sometimes weather is going to be crazy had been cold there recently while you have been doing the construction or it has been pretty good weather?"
"21","  Alright, and have you been out and about besides work recently as well?"
"22","  Okay, and what have you been doing as you are out?"
"23","  Okay, awesome, and how long have you been with your girlfriend?"
"24","  That is awesome, very fine. Alright, and I am glad that she is looking up for your health as well because, it is always a good thing to have someone who cares about that, so have it for you, and so with this cold, has been going on for about a week now, have the symptoms gotten better?  Have they gotten worse?  What would you kind of?"
"25","  It is all the same?"
"26","  Okay.  Have you noticed anything new come on as the week has progressed, like were you coughing as much at the beginning of the week?  It is more coughing now?"
"27","  Alright.  And is this impacting your day to day life?  Like, are you able to go to work with this?  Have you been staying home from work?"
"28","  Been able to go to work?  Alright.  Is it making you like tired or fatigued at all?"
"29","  Okay.  And is that fatigue like long lasting?  Do you need like to sit down or rest at all or is it just kind of general tiredness?"
"30","  Okay.  Alright.  And, on your chart I noticed that you were taking DayQuil as needed.  What you take the DayQuil for?  It is for this cold?"
"31","  Alright.  Has that been helping at all?"
"32","  Alright, and in what ways does it help you?"
"33","  With the cough?  Alright.  Does it make you a less frequent cough?  It is less forceful?"
"34","  Okay, but about the same frequency then?"
"35","  Alright.  And, have you noticed any difference in the sputum itself with this cough?  Is this still that kind of off white with DayQuil?"
"36","  Oh, did you hear that last question?"
"37","  Alright, that is not a problem.  Sometimes the internet kind of has an issue once in a while.  So, you are all good.  I was asking about with the DayQuil, has that helped like the cough at all with the color of the sputum.  Has that changed it at all or is that pretty similar?"
"38","  Okay.  So, basically the DayQuil has basically just made it less forceful of a cough which is always a good thing.  So, alright.  Are there any other symptoms that you noticed with this cold?"
"39","  Alright.  So, you mentioned COVID as a possible fear because that is a prevalent thing right now and so do you know if you have been around anyone who has had COVID-19?"
"40","  Okay.  And has your girlfriend been experiencing any of these symptoms?"
"41","  Alright.  And are you two living together or you are living separately right now?"
"42","  Living together?  Alright.  Has she has been kind of like keeping distance from you this week or you have been sick or is that been pretty normal?"
"43","  Okay.  Well, that is a good sign that she has not experienced any symptoms.  Are you vaccinated for COVID-19?"
"44","  Alright.  So, with that, that definitely is a fear that we don’t' really have that natural protection.  So, COVID-19 might be more easily contracted by you just because you have the vaccine, but that is not a problem.  We can do a COVID test.  Is that something that you would want to be done today just to make sure you do or don't have COVID?"
"45","  Alright.  We can definitely call and order in for that test to be taken and what that consist of usually it's either like a saliva test so you can like spit into a tube.  They collect the saliva and then they send that off or they do a nasal swab where they put that stick really far up your nose.  It is not too bad.  And then they ____ swallow around in there and then they send those off as well to be tested, and then you should get your results back in like 24 to 72 hours depending on the testing facility based on where they are, and so that is you would like to do then?"
"46","  Alright.  And do you have access to transportation to be able to get to a testing site."
"47","  Alright, perfect.  I want to make sure that you have those resources available for that, and we know that we have not seen here you before, but do you have any other like health history that you have had in the past, so we can kind of get you established here with this care?"
"48","  Diarrhea for quite some time?  Is that like going on currently or is that kind of like intermittent deal?"
"49","  Once a week?  Okay.  Have you experienced that with this cold then as well?"
"50","  Okay, so it has been a long going thing.  How long would you say that has been going on for?"
"51","  Two to three years?  Alright.  And, it is kind of a long time ago but can you remember if you like changed anything in your diet two to three years ago?  Or, can you think of anything that might be contributing to this?"
"52","  Alright.  Yeah.  It’s a long time you got, ____ that is perfectly fine and with the diarrhea, is it usually like at the same, like you said it is weekly.  Is that kind of like very regular thing every single week or is it like more some weeks, less some weeks?"
"53","  About the same every week? Okay.  So, it is very consistent then and does it bother you at all or is it like kind of hindering your day to day life at all?"
"54","  Alright.  Yeah.  We will definitely keep an eye on that then and we can and maybe look at some things with your diet.  We can talk about what you are eating and everything in the next visit to see if we can pinpoint anything that might be causing it as well, but anything else in your health history that I should know of?"
"55","  Alright.  It sounds like you are pretty healthy person."
"56","  Yeah, awesome, and we always like to ask about family history.  Do you know if your parents, siblings, if you have any siblings, do they have any health issues that you know of?"
"57","  Awesome, God bless her."
"58","  Okay."
"59","  Okay.  Was your grandfather on your mother's or father's side?"
"60","  Mother side?  Okay.  And then is there anything else in your family that you know of?"
"61","  Perfect.  So, we will make sure we get that down and then we also would like to ask about just like general health related behaviors.  Do you use alcohol at all?"
"62","  Okay.  And so with that how much would you say you drink at those times."
"63","  Just few drinks?  Alright.  And do you eat any tobacco products?"
"64","  No tobacco products?  Alright.  Let's see.  Do you have any sexual partners besides your current girlfriend?"
"65","  Alright.  And then do you feel like you are able to take care like all of your needs financially, physically?"
"66","  Alright.  Perfect.  Well, it sounds like we want to definitely take care of this cold that you have in.  We can try to get something going for that stronger cold medicine to see if that helps.  We can order a COVID test for you as well to see if you do have COVID.  If it does come back negative and the symptoms are still going on, we can do a few other tests.  It is possible that you might have contracted something at work.  We can just kind of test for those as well, especially if this just continues to go on, but colds usually do kind of overcome themselves after about a week or so.  It might take a little longer sometimes, but we do want to keep an eye on this.  So, we will get a COVID test ordered and then we can also make another appointment for a future date, kind of look at your diet and everything and see if there is anything that we can do with the diarrhea that you have been experiencing."
"67","  Do you have any questions for me about anything?"
"68","  Alright.  Well probably it was really nice to meet you today and we hope to see you again soon and hopefully we can get those results back for the COVID test.  I will put those orders in and we will contact you about ways that you can get that COVID test taken care of."
"69","  Yeah, of course.  Also, have you been able to have any home COVID test."
"70","  Okay.  Those are available for purchase.  Sometimes, they are kind of expensive though, so if you can afford those.  That is fine.  There is from the government that they have given four tests for household that you can order in the mail.  So, obviously it would not happen today that you will get those from them, but if you want to go online and get those, I can put a link in the chat you if want."
"71","  Alright.  Let me find that for you.  Alright.  I am going to put that in there now. Alright.  Did that go through?"
"72","  Perfect.  You can go there and order for your COVID test because if this happened to you in the future, if you are exposed or your girlfriend is exposed, then you guys can kind of test yourselves at home to get a general idea if you have or not kind of know if need to stay at home or not.  So, awesome.  Well, do you have any other questions for me today Tom?"
"73","  That should be it today if do not have any other questions?"
"74","  Awesome, well, have a great day Tom.  It was nice to meet you and we will see you next time."
"75","  Bye.  We will see you later.  You can end this chat now."
