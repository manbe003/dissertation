"1","  Hello.  Hi, I think you are muted.  I think you are muted.  I cannot hear you."
"2","  Great. I was just about to message you (Laughing)"
"3","  Yeah."
"4","  Yeah, it was confusing.  I was taking forever to try to message you to Zoom.  I feel like always changes things but hello Freddie, how are you? "
"5","  Okay, okay, my name is Chrissy.  I am part of the care team who is going to see you today and thank you for meeting me."
"6","  Yeah.  So is it okay if I call you Freddie?"
"7","   Okay, great.  So reading your chart it sounds like you are in just kind of for a routine diabetes visit.  It is noted that you had some fatigue that you have noted for the past six months or so."
"8","  Okay.  Yeah.  So can you just tell me a little bit more about how that is going and what happened?"
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Okay, I forgot to mention, if you see me looking down, I am just writing kind of as we are chatting to remember things, okay, so does anything make that go away?"
"11","  Did not really help, okay, um, does it seem to be better or worse after meals?"
"12","  Okay.  But it is usually in the late afternoon."
"13","  And then go ahead."
"14","  Okay.  And then does that feeling kind of last until you go to sleep at night?"
"15","  Okay. okay.  Have you noticed any like muscle pain in your legs or arms or anywhere?"
"16","  No."
"17","  No, okay.  Um, what about like any sort of headaches or fever or anything like that you have noticed?"
"18","  Yeah. Any other symptoms that you can kind of think of, that have been popping up?"
"19","  Okay. okay, how often would you say you pee throughout the day?"
"20","  Okay, four or five times throughout the day.  And then what was it before?"
"21","  Yeah.  And then when you do urinate after you finish peeing, do you still feel like there is more that you need to pee?"
"22","  Okay, so you feel empty after you urinate. okay, and then do you have to wake up in the middle of the night to urinate?"
"23","  When would you say that started?  Like when did the increase in frequency of urinating start?"
"24","  Yeah."
"25","  Okay, yeah.  What do you do for work? "
"26","  Okay."
"27","  Okay, great. "
"28","  You are the guy.  Hahaha."
"29","  Okay"
"30","  Hahaha.  Send him to Freddie.  Hahaha.  Okay. And then anything else you have noticed? So you have had like the fatigue that started probably around six months ago that lingers in the early afternoon to evening and then the increase in urination that started maybe three months ago that sometimes wakes you up at night.  Anything else?"
"31","  Okay.  What about your vision?  Have you been feeling like your glasses have been working well?"
"32","  Okay, good, good. okay.  I am just going to go over some medications that I noticed in your chart.  Are you still taking the metformin?"
"33","  500 mg two times a day? "
"34","  Great.  And then the glipizide 10 mg two times a day, like with meals"
"35","  Okay, great. okay.  Um, and what about when was the last time you got your A1c screening?"
"36","  About a year ago, okay."
"37","  Okay.  And then how has that been checking your blood sugar throughout the week?"
"38","  215 okay, so that is quite high.  So that I think what is it normally at?"
"39","  215 okay, okay.  Do you notice that it is a little higher at night when you are like feeling the fatigue or kind of throughout the day, it is about the smae."
"40","  Or the blood sugar."
"41","  Alright, okay."
"42","   Okay. Okay, um, and can you tell me a little bit about your diet and exercise?"
"43","  Great."
"44","  Great. okay.  Um.  And then what about meals?  What do you typically eat for your meals?"
"45","  Okay.  And then what about, like, lunch dinner?"
"46","  Okay, and then what about dinner?"
"47","  Okay. okay.  Thank you for sharing that."
"48","  Okay.  So from kind of the symptoms you have been explaining to me, kind of the fatigue, the increase in urine, I am thinking a little bit and your  elevated A1c, I do not know if you saw in your chart, but the last one about a year ago, your A1c was like 7.9.  So ideally we want to keep it around maybe 6.5 a little bit lower, so it is a little bit high and that is that test that measures your glucose level, your blood sugar level over the past three months.  So that is a little bit high, so that makes me think that some of these symptoms that you are feeling, could be attributed to some of the diabetes, so it makes me think that it may be just a little bit too much blood sugar, a little too high blood sugar, but that makes sense, so umm, some thoughts that I have.  How have the glipizide has been kind of taking those?"
"49","  Okay, great.  So, some things that could help to decrease the blood sugar, the glipizide is one thing that is great, so that is the insulin that helps lower the blood sugar, so you take that before you get your meals and that kind of helps decrease it.  And then other things that we touched on kind of like diet and exercise.  So diet is one thing that I think there could be some moments of improvement, um, just trying to really focus in on getting those healthy fats in there, so like using olive oil and those like omega-3, so like the salmons instead of the red meat is like one switch that could be really helpful and that could help with this and as well as I also noted that you have a little high cholesterol in your chart as well.  So those two things could be helpful.  How do you feel about any changes to your diet?"
"50","  Right."
"51","  Right."
"52","  Right."
"53","  Yeah.  No, getting away, I think that is great.  I think when you are away there could be moments to kind of maybe think about other options too?  If that is about something that you are up for? So like little substitutions does not have to be a big switch right away.  If you are up to it, maybe like 1/4 pounder plus an apple for a little extra fiber, maybe instead of fries or in addition to fries, so having like a little bit more fiber helps get you fuller faster and it can add a little bit more nutrients in, so it does not have to be a big shift right away, but a little gradual change and consistent change I think we will go a long way and if you are interested, I am happy to talk to your wife too.  I love cooking.  I love like, figuring out little meals and fun things.  I am happy to help facilitate that conversation as well but again, this is your body, your life, I want you to be able to have control over that and decide what you want to put in it.  I am just from the perspective I am a little concerned with some of your health thing, health numbers, and I want to help get you to live the longest, healthiest life that you can."
"54","  Yeah."
"55","  I think an apple is great.  I think that an apple has a lot of fiber, has a lot of vitamins in it, and I think that is a wonderful addition that you could have.  It is just one example though, so it does not have to be an apple."
"56","  Great, yeah, I think apple could be great.  I think little substitutions like focusing on whole grains, so like if you wanted to get like whole wheat things as opposed to white bread things, I am thinking just specifically with bread that has a little bit more fiber in it too, that is a little bit better and I think a big thing is just the oil, so trying to stick away from the oils, so the saturated fat is a little bit not as great. The trans-fat is something that you would want us to go.  It is helpful for you, after I visit, I can kind of type up a little summary of like things that maybe we can add in and things that maybe we can think about taking out if that is helpful.  Sometimes it is nice to have a little cheat sheet, if you will."
"57","  Yeah, yeah and again, this does not have to be like a big switch right away. I found that kind of making gradual changes help kind of reinforce more consistency over time, which I think is more important personally as opposed to just one change that is just for a shorter period of time, so whatever works best for you to kind of make it longer and I think it is great."
"58","  Yeah."
"59","  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can send you that list after.  So, kind of getting back to that blood sugars, one of the ideas was to kind of the those health modifications in terms of your diet.  Another idea that I had in addition, just because it is quite high and I want to kind of get it, get your A1c, that blood sugar level down a little bit quicker, could be a different insulin, a different medication in addition to kind of those immediate release, there is like a longer release medication, I am losing the name of the specific medication now, but I will be able to look it up and get back to you afterwards but there is another medication that you can kind of take in the morning that will last a little bit longer and have because your insulin level kind of like is low and so you kind of the premeal insulin medication gives you like a little blip before your meal and what I want to do is give you a morning insulin to kind of lift your lower level up a little bit as a baseline and then also still have those blips if that makes sense."
"60","  That would be an idea that we can do, because I am a little concerned that the number is quite high, if you are up to it that that is something that."
"61","  I think I would have to look up exactly what the mode of."
"62","  Okay, yeah, let me, I would have to look up exactly which one.  If it is that one, then we can maybe look into just increasing your current doses of glipizide in addition to your other health modifications like the little diet things too and exercise. "
"63","  Yeah.   So I think that could be a good option to start you if that, if that sounds better to you. "
"64","  Yeah, because you are comfortable with that.  Okay. What other questions do you have for me?"
"65","  Okay, great, yeah, let us start with that and start with the diet and then I do want to check in with you and get another A1c because it has been about since we have gotten that number, so if you are comfortable and able to come in to get another blood draw to our, I think it is a little finger poke to get the A1c number again.  It would be great if you can come in later this week."
"66","  Okay, great, yeah, yeah.  You can call my office and then we can kind of get that coordinated too."
"67","  Okay, alright.  Freddie, do you have any more questions for me?"
"68","  Okay, yeah, it was great meeting you.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your day."
"69","  Bye."
