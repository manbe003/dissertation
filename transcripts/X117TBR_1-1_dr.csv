"1","  Hello?"
"2","  Hi, are you Tom?"
"3","  Nice to meet you.  My name is Karina.  I am a medical student that's going to be talking with you today, is that alright? "
"4","  So how can I help you today?"
"5","  Okay.  How about you, do you feel concerned about it?"
"6","  Okay.  And have you noticed any other symptoms with your cough?"
"7","  Okay.  Anything else you've noticed?"
"8","  Feeling like a fever maybe?"
"9","  Okay.  Any night sweats?"
"10","  Difficulty breathing at all?"
"11","  Okay.  Have you ever had a cough like this before?"
"12","  Okay.  Any like runny nose?"
"13","  Okay, alright.  Anything else that’s particularly worrying you today?"
"14","  Yeah, looks like a good idea.  You've got to do this in person though."
"15","  That's alright.  Since it's been a few years, and I think looking at your chart it says you're 58?"
"16","  Alright.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?"
"17","  No.  Okay.  Any family history of cancer at all?"
"18","  Okay."
"19","  Okay.  That is good to know, thank you.  So yeah, that would be one of the things based on your age.  Not necessarily a colonoscopy or the other option would be what we call sort of this card based test where we mail you this card and you put a little bit of poop on it and then you mail it back to us and then we check to see if there's any blood in there and if there is blood then we would ask you to come in for a colonoscopy.  And if there is no blood, then you're good until next year and we do it again."
"20","  How does that sound?"
"21","  Okay, perfect.  And that means you don't have to be here for that.  Perfect.  And then do you know if you're up-to-date on all your vaccinations?"
"22","  Okay.  So some of the ones that we start to recommend at this age are I think like the shingles vaccine, have you heard of that one?"
"23","  Okay, did you get the chickenpox as a kid?"
"24","  Yes, so then the shingles vaccine is usually a good idea to get and there's, it's two vaccines.  They actually end up having similar side effects as the COVID vaccine, but they are highly recommended because as far as I know people that had had shingles say they would never ever want to wish that even on their worst enemy.  So if that's any indication? "
"25","  And that's something you could actually just get at your local pharmacy like Walgreens will have the shingles vaccine as well and they can get that to you.  Have you considered the COVID vaccine at all? "
"26","  Totally understand.  Is there, do you have any questions for me about the vaccine?"
"27","  I would.  I mean, I personally got it.  I'm not necessarily in the age that would be at the highest risk, but I'm also around a lot of patients and my family."
"28","  So I did it mostly to help protect them, especially now that I’ve this brand new nephew born three weeks ago, so you've got to make sure I'm protected, but I've been recommending it to patients, especially as they get older because they are at higher risk of more severe negative effects from the virus."
"29","  Compared to what the potential effects could be from the vaccine, especially because most of the side effects are very similar to those of the shingles vaccine, you might, you know, get basically like a cold for a day.  You might get a little bit tired.  You might get a fever or some, actually muscle ache is also very common and people generally recover within a day or two from those and then we have the protection.  In terms of very severe negative side effects, I, you know, they've been very, very rare.  As you probably heard the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had some more serious side effects that they found in women that put them at risk for clotting, but those side effects have not been found in the other two vaccines, the Moderna and the Pfizer.  Are there anything that you've heard of that make you more worried about the vaccine?"
"30","  Okay, totally understand.  Well, if there's any information that I can try and get you to convince you to get it, I am all ears."
"31","  Sounds good/"
"32","  Awesome.  So I think those are some of the big major things that I wanted to cover with you today.  If you don't mind, I'm going to take a second to run everything back for you.  So, I know you originally came in because your girlfriend wanted you to get a COVID test because you've been having a cough for the last five days and a little bit of phlegm.  You yourself don't seem to be particularly worried and especially since you don't seem to have a fever or any other of the like more worrying COVID symptoms, it's unlikely that you have COVID.  We can test you for it, but it's not necessary at this point."
"33","  And so I would definitely leave that decision up to you.  And then in terms of some of the other general things since we haven’t seen you for a few years, it would be great to get you some cancer screening like that’s the card test that we talked about for colon cancer screening and get you up-to-date on some of your vaccines including the shingles and hopefully the COVID."
"34","  Okay?  Am I missing anything?"
"35","  I would love for you to come in, in person."
"36","  Just to…because we would also since it's been a few years, we'd want to get some labs on you just to check to see how, like your blood sugar levels are doing, how your cholesterol levels are doing, check how your kidney is doing and your liver is doing, just some general things to check up on you and your body and make sure everything is functioning the way we want it to."
"37","  Yeah."
"38","  Alright?"
"39","  Sounds good."
"40","  Sounds good.  Nice to meet you too."
"41","  Bye."
