"1","  Is that better?  Is that better?"
"2","  Okay and I can see you and you can see me right?  Do I need to do that, okay is that a better view?"
"3","  Tom, Tom is good.  You can call me Tom, yes."
"4","  Well, my girlfriend has been bugging me for the last few days, the last few weeks.  Well, actually last few days to come in and be checked for possibly having COVID.  And so I have a cough and so I would just like to, you know, be checked or maybe have a test for the COVID virus."
"5","  Well, basically all I have had is you know coughing up a little phlegm and it's been, you know, like I said approximately five days and that's really, like I said, she is concerned that it could be something more serious."
"6","  No."
"7","  No."
"8","  No, just a little warm sometimes, but nothing uncomfortable, no."
"9","  No."
"10","  Not that I'm aware of.  My girlfriend, she is a teacher and so she is around children all the time and so that could be part of her concern."
"11","  She is vaccinated, but I'm not."
"12","  No."
"13","  No."
"14","  No.  Not that I'm…"
"15","  Not that I'm aware of."
"16","  Not that I'm aware of, no."
"17","  I cannot hear you.  I see your mouth moving, but your voice is breaking up and now I've lost all of your sound.  Can you hear me okay?"
"18","  It looks as if you are having some technical problem."
"19","  I can still see you, but I can't hear you."
"20","  I can hear you now, yes, but your voice was breaking up, it was coming in, in bits and pieces, but not a flow."
"21","  Yes, I can hear you okay now, yes.  A notice has come up that your bandwidth is low."
"22","  Can you read that?"
"23","  Okay, it says on my end here, it says that your bandwidth is low."
"24","  Better."
"25","  No.  I'm a laborer, construction laborer for a company here in Seattle, but we are outside, you know, 95% of the time and I wear my mask.  And so, occasionally, you know, I may not have my mask, but obviously the majority of the time I wear my mask."
"26","  Yes, I would like to have if at all possible a COVID test if nothing more than to please my girlfriend and let her know that, that I'm okay."
"27","  Tomorrow being Sunday maybe not, but I could check into it, I could go on to the website and see what may be available close to where I live or you know, and even if it's only maybe 30 minutes away, I could drive in and do that, yes."
"28","  Well, would that entail not going for me not to be going to work or to have more of a spacing with my coworkers."
"29","  Okay, that's a plan, yes, okay."
"30","  Yes, I could do, I could like I said I could research on the web sites that are, you know doing the test tomorrow, like you said pharmacies are doing it, so there probably is a long list of places that I could get tested."
"31","  And so I would, you know, yes, I could do that."
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Yes.  That sounds like a plan."
"34","  Okay, okay. All right."
"35","  Yes, is there anything else that I should be thinking about or concerned or do you have any other questions for me?"
"36","  Okay, so since we're here now that's where you were saying there's not much more we can talk about now in in terms of my general overall health or anything like that?"
"37","  I just want to ensure that I'm still healthy.  I haven’t been in to see a doctor in 10 years.  So you can pretty much understand why my girlfriend is, you know, shoving me out the door, you know, trying to get me to come in to be tested."
"38","  Yes."
"39","  Sure, sure."
"40","  Okay, okay."
"41","  Okay, all right.  Sounds great."
"42","  That's okay."
"43","  Okay, same here.  I'll look forward to seeing you as well.  Okay, all right."
"44","  Welcome, thank you.  Bye-bye."
