"1","  Okay there we are, how are you?"
"2","  I am doing okay."
"3","  Tom, yes, Tom works for me, yes.  And you are?"
"4","  Dana? Okay."
"5","  Well, my girlfriend has been kind of hassling me and challenging me for the, for the last couple of weeks about, excuse me, coming in and getting tested for COVID.  I have a cough and so she just wanted to make sure that it’s not anything more serious than that.  So that’s the reason I am here."
"6","  Oh, about two weeks ago."
"7","  The only other symptom that I have is, I am sleeping and I am tired a little more, sleeping a little more than usual."
"8","  No, not that I can actually put my finger on.  I think it’s running around probably about 99."
"9","  No, no."
"10","  No."
"11","  Yes, I am getting a little bit of phlegm that’s coming up and it’s just like white colored mucus."
"12","  Not that I am aware of, no."
"13","  No."
"14","  No."
"15","  I work construction and so I am around people all the time, but no one as far as I know is, that has been ill or sick from COVID, yes."
"16","  No, no."
"17","  No, but I have been for the last week, week and a half I have been taking DayQuil for my cough."
"18","  Yes."
"19","  That sounds about right, yes."
"20","  Nothing else was going on and I felt rather normal."
"21","  Yes, my mother had breast cancer, but she you know she beat that and so, and my grandfather, he had colon cancer, but that was some years ago and I was very young when that happened, so I don’t know.  I think he must have survived it for a while."
"22","  No, not that I ______."
"23","  No, no."
"24","  No, no."
"25","  Two to three beers occasionally during the course of the week, but that’s just about it."
"26","  Really I am not that concerned.  I am here because my girlfriend has been, you know, kind of hassling for me to come in and see you to make sure that it’s not COVID.  She is a teacher, so and she is vaccinated so I can understand her concern, but as far as I am concerned I don’t have any real issues."
"27","  Well, I have been reading a lot of different material about the COVID and so I just haven’t really made up my mind about whether it’s good, bad or indifferent.  So and that’s probably one of the reasons I haven’t got any shot is that, there is a lot of pros and cons about it."
"28","  Okay, okay.  Well, since we are here, do you think, and it has been a while since I have been in approximately about 10 years it would be, do you think we should take a look at anything else?"
"29","  Okay, all right.  Well, you know, so like I said, since we are here and going through this, I was just wondering if there is any other concerns or issues that I should be concerned about or you may be concerned about?"
"30","  Oh okay, okay, all right, that sounds like a plan.  Okay."
"31","  No, not at this time.  I am going to try and not to wait another 10 years to have a visit, but yes, but I do thank you and if you could schedule those tests may be like on a Saturday, I don’t know if the clinic is open or anything like that, because I work construction five days a week, Monday to Friday."
"32","  Okay, all right.  Okay all right, well thank you so much Dana.  Do you have any more questions for me?"
"33","  Okay, I am sorry that I was distracted.  It is hailing where I am right now and ______ locked."
"34","  ______ our visit here, but I was distracted, I am sorry."
"35","  Okay, thank you so much.  Okay?  All right."
