"1","  Hi Freddy."
"2","  Fred, how are you?"
"3","  My name is Kim and I am a medical student and today I am going to be asking you a few questions based on your reason for the visit today.  Is that okay?"
"4","  Okay.  So, I looked through your charts, and based on what it says, it notes that you have been having difficulty standing recently.  Can you tell me a little more about that?"
"5","  Okay.  Swelling and tingling.  And how long has this been going on?"
"6","  Okay.  Do you know if there is any triggers associated with this?"
"7","  No, okay.  And you have been having swelling and tingling, have you been having any pain or weakness?"
"8","  Any bowel or bladder problems?  Like feeling like you are constipated or having diarrhea, feeling like?"
"9","  Okay.  And I noticed that you also have diabetes.  Do you know what your blood sugar levels are normally running at?"
"10","  215, and is this after meal or before any meal?"
"11","  Does the pain or the tingling in your legs radiate anywhere, like, does it radiate up your back, does it radiate down to your foot?"
"12","  Okay.  Then how worse would you say the tingling is?  Like on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst its ever been, 1 being moderately, not really ____?"
"13","  Okay.  Anything that makes it better?"
"14","  And it’s both legs, right?"
"15","  Okay.  Alright, and then what’s your current medicine regime? Like what kind of insulin are you taking every day?"
"16","  Okay.  And are you taking that pretty consistently?"
"17","  Okay.  Have you been having any recent chest pain, any shortness of breath?"
"18","  Okay.  Right.  And then any other symptoms that you have noticed besides the tingling in the legs?"
"19","  No, okay.  Alright.  I think these are all the questions I have.  Do you have any questions for me?"
"20","  Okay.  So, that’s all I have."
"21","  Thank you so much."
