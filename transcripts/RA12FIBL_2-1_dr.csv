"1","  Hi, Tom.  I can see that you’re in the chat but I can’t hear or see you.  Can you hear me?  You can type it into the chat or if you know how to press the unmute button, feel free to."
"2","  Hi, there."
"3","  Is this Tom?"
"4","  Nice to meet you, Tom.  My name is J.J.  I am a student."
"5","  You know, I am a student with the UW and I understand that you’re coming in for a general checkup today."
"6","  Okay, great and Tom I can’t quite see you, do you have webcam on your end?"
"7","  Can you see me now?  Tom, can you see or hear me?  Tom if you can hear me, there should be in the lower left corner of your screen, I guess it doesn’t show backwards, unmute button, could you hit that for me?"
"8","  Okay.  Let’s see.  Can you see me now?  Tom, can you go ahead and hit that unmute button again?  Tom, so Tom, I don’t know if you can see or hear me, I want to chat in the chat window as well."
"9","  Perfect, can you hear me?"
"10","  Excellent.  So, you know I think it’s always so buggy.  Can you see me now?"
"11","  Okay, well, if it’s alright with you, I want to make sure I am addressing all of your concerns today, so."
"12","  Why don’t we treat this as a phone appointment?"
"13","  Great and so it sounds like you’re coming in to talk about your health generally, is there anything in specific that you’re concerned about, you want to check in about today?"
"14","  Tell me more about that."
"15","  Yeah and so you’ve had a cough for about a week.  Have you ever had a cough like this before?"
"16","  Okay, what’s the cough like, the cough, when you’re coughing?"
"17","  Okay, any blood with the cough, any sputum?"
"18","  Some clear stuff, and are you feeling short of breathe at all?"
"19","  Okay, anytime that you feel like you’re fainting or you just feeling really fatigued?"
"20","  Okay and I saw in your chart, there is no you feel like you’re still smelling okay, still testing okay?"
"21","  Okay, have you had anyone around you that you think might have COVID lately?"
"22","  Okay.  Have you been out in public lately?"
"23","  Okay, what kind of work do you do?"
"24","  Oh cool and what kind of construction like anything involved with a lot of ____?"
"25","  My dad does like glasswork sometimes."
"26","  Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"27","  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the reason I asked so I just want to know more about you is sometimes people kind of have small particles, especially do you wear like any sort of lung protection at work like a mask or anything like that?"
"28","  Okay, and then any fevers that you’re aware of any like?"
"29","  Okay, have you been taking your temperature at all?"
"30","  Okay, anyone at home that’s been feeling sick too?"
"31","  And Tom, do you live pretty close to your COVID testing site?"
"32","  Okay, you know kind of put in to see two separate buckets right now just starting off of your COVID concerns versus kind of the general checkup stuff."
"33","  I do think just because you’ve been having these symptoms seems like they have lingering for a week and I think it’s good for you to know, especially if you’re going to work where you are around other people, it might be worth getting tested."
"34","  Yeah, would be okay getting tested in the next couple of days?"
"35","  Excellent and then if you do test positive you know I think first reach out to us to us know if you have any worsening symptoms, but do you have any past like lung issues?"
"36","  Okay.  So, whenever anyone tested, have you had the vaccine at all?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  That’s fair.  Do you have any concerns about the COVID vaccine?"
"39","  Yeah, that makes sense.  If you do ever have anything concerns you want to talk about and thinking about getting it or feeling a little reluctant to, we can always talk about that too?"
"40","  And so you know it sounds like right now you’re doing okay, just kind of a cough, kind of a fever and maybe a little fatigued?"
"41","  Okay, let’s get you checked out and until you get a positive test, till you get your test result back, I am wondering if you would be able to stay at home for a couple of days?"
"42","  Okay, yeah and if you need like a doctor’s note or anything for work, just let me know."
"43","  Okay and then you know just in kind of general for your checkup, how long has it been since you are last to the doctors?"
"44","  Oh wow, so it’s been a bit."
"45","  And anything in particular keeping you from the doctors?"
"46","  Yeah, yeah, especially right now, I understand that would be still concerning and any past surgeries or health issues that you are dealing with?"
"47","  Good, I would like to hear that.  Any family health issues, any like issues of cancer or heart disease in your family at a young age?"
"48","  Good, good.  Both your parents still around?"
"49","  Both are gone?"
"50","  Sorry to hear that.  Do you mind if I ask how they passed?"
"51","  Natural, okay, kind of what health, what age?"
"52","  Okay, well, you know I think 80 is a pretty standard time for things to start piling up unfortunately. "
"53","  But it sounds like no one in your family dying before the age of 60?"
"54","  Okay and do you take any medications daily?"
"55","  Okay, even over-the-counter stuff like ibuprofen, Tylenol, Tums?"
"56","  Wow, okay and then tell me a little bit about your diet?"
"57","  Okay, would you say everyday for the?"
"58","  Yeah, so, I think everyone is a little different in how they handle those foods, could you tell me a little bit about like how often you’re eating like vegetables, fruits and what kinds?"
"59","  Okay, and then kind of thinking about alcohol, sounds like you have a couple of beers every night?"
"60","  Okay and like 12 ounce cans, just one or two of those or?"
"61","  16, okay."
"62","  And do you ever drink more than like three of those during the night?"
"63","  Okay, do you ever wake up hung-over?"
"64","  Okay, okay and then any tobacco use?"
"65","  Okay, any marijuana use?"
"66"," And then you know everything we talk about stays between us, I just want to get a sense for your health, any elicit substance use like heroin or meth or anything like that?"
"67","  Okay, okay, good and then exercise, do you outside of you know kind of work and getting around and kind of those activities, fitness, what you do for exercise?"
"68","  I see you get a decent amount, how often you’re getting a couple mile bike ride?"
"69","  Couple times a month, okay."
"70","  That’s pretty good, you know I think the thing that stands out to me about your diet is with red meat, especially and with like purified sugars, one thing we worry about is kind of the risk in the long-term of like cholesterol and diabetes.  So, anyone ever talk to you about those?"
"71","  Oh, do you know when she was diagnosed?"
"72","  But it sounds like something, do you know if she ever had to take insulin or any complications from it?"
"73","  Okay, anyone else in your family with diabetes?"
"74","  Okay, well, you know I think it’s so hard with COVID with these virtual appointments because we’re kind of talking out on the phone but since it’s been a few years since you’ve been to the doctor, I would like to get some kind of regular labs just to see where your blood works at, is that okay, check your blood sugar and your cholesterol?"
"75","  Okay and I don’t want to hit you with too much.  I think that another thing you know with this COVID going on, just getting you tested in a couple of days is a good idea but I was wondering if anyone has ever talked to you about colon cancer screening?"
"76","  Okay.  So, you know one thing that like we recommend for everyone over the age of 50 is that they have regular screening for colon cancer, it’s, there is a few different ways that it’s done, do you ever heard of a colonoscopy?"
"77","  Yeah, yeah, that’s the, tell me little bit more than about that, what you know about it?"
"78","  Kind of, so, there is a few different ways they do it now, one option is every year or so, there is this little card that I can send by mail where you can take a fecal sample and you mail it back to me and if there is any blood then they do is called colonoscopy where they take a tube and like a little camera on the end and kind of insert it up your rectum and while you’re under anesthesia."
"79","  And check just to make sure there is no cancer, nothing that’s concerning, that’s one option and if the card is negative like the card has no blood on it then you just wait until next year and you send me another card.  The other option is you can go straight to the colonoscopy and then as long as there is nothing worry, they wouldn’t have to repeat that for five years and we like to do that especially with folks who have kind of diets high in red meat because colon cancer is one of those cancers where you really want to find it early and it starts to crop up in people around 50 even if there is no major family history."
"80","  So, nothing you have to decide today but you know you’re kind of in that age range, I do think we should get the blood work sooner rather than later but I do want the colon screening on your radar."
"81","  Do you want to maybe meet up in a couple of weeks to see how your cough is doing and just talk a little bit more about in the meantime to get those labs to just kind of see how you’re doing with your health?"
"82","  Okay.  Now I don’t want to make any changes today, but are there any medications you are worried that you might need help with for this cough or anything else I can do with you?"
"83","  Well, you know I just want to make sure that with treating it adequately, if things are getting worse, do you feel comfortable reaching out to us?"
"84","  Okay, great.  So, Tom, let’s go ahead and meet in a couple of weeks and get that blood work and talk about and if you do end up testing positive, please let us know sooner, any other questions, oh sorry?"
"85","  Okay and do you know if we can see in person sometime in the next year now that COVID is kind of winding down, I think that would be good just listen to your heart and lungs and you know kick the tires."
"86","  Alright, delighted to meet you, Tom.  Take care."
