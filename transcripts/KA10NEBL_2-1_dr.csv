"1","  Hi, are you Mr. Jones?"
"2","  Pleasure to meet you.  My name is Jesse.  How are you today?"
"3","  Yeah, today is our first time meeting.  Thanks so much for making the time today to talk to me."
"4","  Of course.  The lovely computer here has got me up to speed a little bit on about who you are and your medical history and why we are here today but I’d love to hear from you about what you’d like to talk about today and get to know you a little bit better."
"5","  And it sounds like that’s been going on for about the last six months?"
"6","  Any other changes during that time?"
"7","  Yeah, any idea about what could be causing the tiredness?"
"8","  Well congrats, that’s awesome."
"9","  Just getting into anything."
"10","  How long have you guys been watching them?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  You know, how special, I bet I don’t know if they know it yet but they sure are lucky to have you guys as grandparents to be able to do that, that’s really awesome."
"13","  Yeah, what else is on your mind?"
"14","  Okay, what is the yellow?"
"15","  Okay, have you been checking your sugars every day?"
"16","  Okay, what is the normal number for you?"
"17","  Okay, how long is it, well let me say that a different way, when have you been taking your blood sugars?"
"18","  Okay, about twice a week and do you take anything else at home like blood pressure or anything like that?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  And it looked like it was okay at that time.  The only medications I see in your chart are metformin known as Glucophage, that sound familiar?"
"21","  You do that twice a day and then there is also glipizide, Glucotrol."
"22","  Yep, twice a day and any problems with those medications?"
"23","  Yeah and it looks like you had some blood work done about a month ago and it looks like your hemoglobin A1c at that time was, you know, in the diabetic range about what we would expect, so, no surprises there.  It is a tad bit higher than it was about this time last year.  So, it’s at 7.9 versus 7.6 last year, but you know ideally for somebody that is a diabetic anything under 8 is okay."
"24","  Do you have any questions?"
"25","  Right."
"26","  Yeah, no absolutely, absolutely.  Have you had that conversation in the past about insulin and what that looks like day-to-day?"
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Yeah, yeah and I don’t think we are there yet.  Have you met in the past with somebody called like a diabetes counselor or a nutritionist, any of that sound familiar?"
"29","  Okay.  So, from what I see in your chart the current medications you are on talking to you and hearing about you, it sounds like you’re really active, that you would like to have more energy throughout the day and I also, I can appreciate from your chart that we still have a lot of things to play with and to work with and to try before you even need to start worrying about your, what your diabetes is going to look like down the line?"
"30","  Yeah, yeah.  So, the two things that I would like to talk for the rest of the visit about today is maybe optimizing your diabetes treatment and then also getting a little bit more history about this tiredness but I would like to kind of wrap up the diabetes talk first, does that sound all right with you?"
"31","  So, my general approach and kind of philosophy to medicine is to have you on is you know few medications as possible you know just trying to be as efficient and keep as much out of you that we don’t need but I see kind of two things that we can add on to your medication.  So, that’s two additional medications in it on top of your metformin and your glipizide.  The only change I would make to your current two medications is your metformin right now, it’s not the long-acting metformin and so it’s really the same drug but I would like to make a change so that the 500 mg that you take twice a day lasts longer, so there is not these peaks and valleys in the medication.  So, that should be a really easy change, any questions about that?"
"32","  Yeah, so that metformin will stay the same dose but it’s going to say metformin XR, so it’s going to be a more stable dose in your bloodstream throughout the day. "
"33","  No, if you’ve been tolerating the metformin for the last eight years like you have, I wouldn’t expect any difference.  Now, if you do start to experience any different symptoms, the most common are going to be an upset stomach or diarrhea, maybe they talked to you about that in the past when you first started it."
"34","  And some people when they do change their medications, they do notice the difference and if that does happen then we can go back to your old metformin but that might give us a little bit better more constant control on your blood sugar since you’ve been noticing they’ve been running a little bit high and your blood test is a little bit higher over the last year, I think that’s an easy change that we can do."
"35","  But the two other medications that come to my mind to add to and let me know if you’ve heard of these two in the past, one is called the statin and one is an aspirin."
"36","  Yeah, so 81 mg a day, it’s called the baby aspirin, just a really small pill and it’s good to protect your heart."
"37","  And we don’t have any other labs on you from other than the A1c that I am able to look at right now but things that we would, things that we want to protect are your heart and your blood vessels and your brain and the aspirin helps with that and the statin also helps with that too.  The aspirin, statins and metformin, they’re generally the three things that we like to see all of our diabetes patients on because it has protective effects and it keeps a lot of people from having unnecessary complications."
"38","  What questions do you have about those new drugs?"
"39","  Yeah but generally we we’ll have all of our diabetes patients on a statin as well.  My understanding is that diabetes patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, stroke and I see that in your past you’ve had high lipid blood levels and also some high blood pressures in the past and so you know quite frankly I think it’s you know an important addition that we add on to your drug regimen just to make sure that we’re you know covering all of our bases and making sure that we’re being as conservative but preventative as we can."
"40","  Okay, so that’s those are the changes that I would like to make to your diabetes care.  We’re going to change the metformin, you shouldn’t notice anything else, you’re going to take it otherwise exactly the same.  You will take your baby aspirin in the mornings along with your glipizide and metformin and then generally statins are most effective if you take them at night.  So, just once a day at night and that’s when we would like to add that one on and at the end of the visit, you’ll get a summary sheet that explains all the stuff and the new medications will be sent to your pharmacy and it should be as easy as that."
"41","  Great and I would like to see you again in about you know three to six weeks to check in on you again and see how you’re doing with those new medications, Okay, so what questions do you have?"
"42","  Okay, if any come to mind don’t feel you know hesitant to reach out or anything like that.  We’re always here to answer good questions and the rest of is that I would like to spend exploring a little bit more about this new fatigue that you’ve been experiencing, it adds a little bit more detail saying that you have trouble standing for more than two hours?"
"43","  Yeah, when did that first start?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Yeah.  How far are you normally able to walk without needing a break?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Yeah, what symptoms do you start to feel when you feel like you need to take a break or what causes you to need to sit down?"
"48","  Okay and now do both of your legs hurt?"
"49","  Do they hurt any other part of the day or doing any other activities?"
"50","  Okay.  You mentioned when you were first diagnosed with diabetes about eight years ago that you were having some tingling in your feet.  Have you had any of those symptoms since being treated for diabetes?"
"51","  Okay.  Did they have an idea of what that was related to at the time?"
"52","  Okay."
"53","  Yeah and you haven’t had any symptoms like that any other part of the time or in any other part of your body?"
"54","  Okay. Tell me a little bit more about this back pain?"
"55","  Okay."
"56","  Okay and do you ever take anything for either your leg pain or your back pain?"
"57","  When was the last time that you had to take or wanted to take ibuprofen?"
"58","  Okay.  So, it’s been quite a while."
"59","  Okay, let’s see. This leg pain, does it resolve pretty quickly when you take a break after walking?"
"60","  Okay and if you were to qualify it or to describe it to me in as much detail as possible, how would you do so?"
"61","  Okay."
"62","  Yeah, what part of your leg, does it affect?"
"63","  Like at the calf or behind the knee?"
"64","  Anytime in your butt?"
"65","  Okay and the quality of this pain you said it’s kind of achy soreness?"
"66","  Yeah."
"67","  Yeah, and it’s on both legs equally?"
"68","  Okay.  Have you had any trouble walking or any weakness?"
"69","  Okay, any sensation differences like you noticed that when you put on your pants or when you touch your legs that they feel different?"
"70","  Okay, they are just, you know, these are all just kind of general screening questions I ask anybody that has leg or back pain.  So, I am not trying to put words in your mouth or find anything, I just want to make sure I am doing kind of a head-to-toe thorough job."
"71","  But I don’t hear anything that’s extremely concerning to me, if it does become more bothersome to you, please let me know or if it changes at all.  I imagine that you know walking a mile is pretty significant and anybody would likely have soreness but if you do notice that it changes either in duration or if it doesn’t improve immediately with rest, please let us know but I would like to reassure you that the back pain and leg pain while bothersome are likely of note you know real pathology, really I think it sounds pretty kind of run-of-the-mill aches and pains, does that sound understandable?"
"72","  Yeah."
"73","  Yeah, and with somebody as active as you and you know working and chasing those grandkids around you know I think I would be more surprised if you didn’t have any aches or pains."
"74","  Now, Freddy about the fatigue at night for the last six months, I just have a couple of more questions about that.  You had told me earlier that you didn’t notice any you know real changes to what you are doing during the day that would maybe make you more tired.  I was wondering if what your wife might say about you being more tired or how she would give information into this?"
"75","  Yeah."
"76","  Yeah.  Do you have to take a nap during the day?"
"77","  Okay."
"78","  Yeah, yeah."
"79","  Yeah, and you’ve been sleeping all right, you’ve mentioned between seven, eight hours most nights?"
"80","  How do you feel when you normally wake up in the morning?"
"81","  Yeah, good and then you get more progressively tired throughout the day, is that correct?"
"82","  Okay, okay, is it generally around like lunch time or before or after you eat?"
"83","  After that, okay.  Do you ever wake up at night?"
"84","  It’s pretty common especially as men aged to be waking up one to two times at night mostly to go to the bathroom."
"85","  You find yourself having to go to the bathroom most nights?"
"86","  Okay."
"87","  Yeah, yeah understandable."
"88","  Okay."
"89","  Well at our next visit we’re coming up on our time today, at our next visit, I would like to chat with you a little bit more about specific health screening things.  You’re about the age where I'd start to talk to patients about prostate health and the changes that are likely to be coming in the next 5 to 10 years.  You may notice in the next 5 to 10 years that you start have to waking up during the night more often but we can chat with that next time, it’s nothing to worry about it’s totally normal just something to you know bring some questions about if there are any or if you have any other concerns but in relation to the fatigue you know I would recommend good sleep hygiene and it sounds like you’re on a pretty good sleep schedule getting to seven, eight hours a night, I am reassured to hear that you feel rested for the most part in the morning especially after that cup of coffee, I know how important that is."
"90","  But if you find yourself becoming more concerned or more fatigued or needing a nap most days, please let me know, I’ll definitely chat with you sooner rather than later in the next year but it sounds to me not that it’s normal but that it is extremely common to be fatigued especially around that you know post lunch 2 to 3 p.m. time and you know I want to give you the confidence that I can give you that it is all right to have another cup of coffee at that time if you do need to especially to play with those grandkids but that’s about all I’ve got for you, what questions do you have for me?"
"91","  Well, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions.  Again, I’m going to summarize everything that we talked about today in a paper and give that to you.  You know Freddy just to make sure that I explained everything well and for my own understanding, can you please tell me what our plan is going to be moving forward with things that we chatted about today?"
"92","  All right.  Any other questions, does that all make sense?"
"93","  Okay, it was very nice to meet you, I hope to meet with you again and again in about three to six weeks our scheduler at the front or at the checkout process of this virtual thing will get you to set up with that but if anything comes up in the meantime, give our clinic a call and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can."
"94","  All right.  Thanks, Freddy, it’s a pleasure."
