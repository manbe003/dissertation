"1","  Hello.  I think you are muted.  Sorry, I think you are muted on YouTube.  I do not know if there is a way for me to unmute you."
"2","  Hello."
"3","  Hi"
"4","  Are your Mr. Jones "
"5","  Hi, I am Megan."
"6","  It is nice to meet you.  I am a medical student.  I was going to talk to you today about what is bringing you into the doctor and how we can help you."
"7","  Hmm, hmm."
"8","  Oh okay.  Yeah.  So, that is the fatigue it sounds like."
"9","  You are feeling tired.  You are feeling down.  Okay.  Is that like your #1 thing you want to talk about today?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Yeah, okay."
"12","  Yeah, a little bit of an annual checkup.  Okay, that sounds good.  Is there anything else? "
"13","  That is the main one.  Okay that sounds good.  Okay.  So, maybe we will start with the diabetes because you mentioned that and you said it has been about a year since you have seen a doctor."
"14","  Okay.  I can see that you are on a couple of medications for diabetes."
"15","  Have you been able to take those regularly?"
"16","  Yeah that is perfect."
"17","  Okay, but not too much, okay."
"18","  Okay.  Do you check your blood glucose at home?"
"19","  Okay.  How often do you do that and how has that been going?"
"20","  Okay.  In the mornings, like before you eat breakfast?"
"21","  Okay.  What have the numbers been like?"
"22","  Hmm okay.  And that is sort of the new normal, like low 200s."
"23","  Okay, okay.  Do you have like a goal blood glucose that you usually you would like to see? Yeah."
"24","  Hmm.  Yeah.  Do you like to be in the green?"
"25","  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  All right and how long have you had diabetes?"
"26","  Okay, all right and have you have been on the same medication since then?"
"27","  Oh, sorry. Can you repeat that, it cut out a little bit."
"28","  They upped it.  Okay.  Was that like a year ago or when did they do that?"
"29","  Okay, okay.  Do you do anything else beside the medications to manage your diabetes?"
"30","  Yeah, that is great like a nice daily walk orâ€¦."
"31","  Um.  Hmm."
"32","  Okay.  Yeah, that is good.  Every bit helps.  Okay.  Do you do anything with your diet?"
"33","  Hmm, okay."
"34","  Yeah, okay.  Have you talked in the past with like trying to cut down sugar in your diet to help with the diabetes management?"
"35","  Oh yeah, that's fair."
"36","  Gotcha, oh you are shopping okay, cool (Laughs).  Well, we do not want to annoy you and we do not want to tell you what to do about your diet, but that is definitely one of the like major tools we have to help with diabetes, is like trying to figure out small places that are tolerable that like might help decrease the sugar that you are taking into your body."
"37","  But that is not to be a discussion for today.  Just so, you know, that is like one of the tools that we can use to help with management of diabetes, in addition to the meds and things."
"38","  Okay, okay.  So, you have diabetes for a while, and I think I saw an A1c secondarily brought up again, a relatively recent A1c from three months ago.  Have you seen that number?"
"39","  Okay.  I have one from this March that says your A1c was 7.9, which is a little bit high and it has been kind of creeping up over time."
"40","   Yeah.  So before that, like a year before that, it was 7.6, and about six months before that, it was 7.4.  So, they have slowly doing this increasing thing and the A1c is basically the longer term track of blood glucose.  And so that gives us a good idea of like how your diabetes management is going."
"41","  So, like your blood glucose that you stick your finger with, you probably know this, because you had diabetes for awhile, it is like in that moment what your blood glucose is and the A1c tells us like an average over about three months, how your blood glucose has been doing.  So, you could like have a really big meal, and like a bunch of sugar, and that will shoot your blood glucose up in that instant, but maybe it is just like a once and off, but if your A1c starts to go up, it tells us that your blood glucose is more regularly elevated and staying up over a longer period of time. And so, that probably there is a little bit of room to, like, manage your diabetes a little bit more intensively and that that might certainly would not be the only thing, but that that might help with fatigue and also that we definitely, like, I would if you were willing to do that definitely recommend that we do that today.  And like because that can be one component of fatigue, and then also look at other things same time."
"42","  How does that sound?"
"43","  Okay.  So that will be one thing.  How long has this fatigue been bothering you?"
"44","  Okay.  Can you describe it a little more for me, like when you say you are fatigued, what are you noticing?"
"45","  Hmm, hmm."
"46","  Hmm."
"47","  Hmm."
"48","  Hmm."
"49","  Yeah."
"50","  Yeah."
"51","  (Laughs).  Yeah, yeah.  How old are they?"
"52","  Oh cute, good __range__."
"53","  Yeah, yeah (laughs)"
"54","  (Laughs) That is true (laughs).  They are high energy little toddler beings."
"55","  Yeah, yeah (laughs) no in between (laughs).  Okay.  So, you are falling asleep when you get off work, when you do not want to be, like you want to be watching grandkids, but you cannot quite stay awake."
"56","  Okay and how are you sleeping at night?"
"57","  Okay.  Do you wake up feeling refreshed?"
"58","  Okay."
"59"," Yeah.  Okay.  What do you do for work?"
"60","  Oh, cool."
"61","  (Laughs) What are you for that?  Okay.  It is a big year for that, I think it is very ________ "
"62","  It is pretty stressful."
"63"," Yeah.  Hopefully, we are on the, you know, upswing into better things."
"64","  Yeah, yeah, that is great.  Okay, all right.  So, it sounds like you are sleeping okay.  Do you know if you snore or has your wife ever commented on this?"
"65","  No snoring, okay and no times where she will notice that you seem like you stopped breathing while you are sleeping, like you are holding your breath kind of thing."
"66","  Yeah, yeah, usually, we just have to check because sometimes if your sleep is being disrupted, even though even if you are not waking up and realizing it, that can make you more tired, but it sounds like that is not happening for you."
"67","  Yeah, yeah (laughs).  It sounds good.  Okay.  And then have you noticed any like, when you are exerting yourself, like when you are going on those walks or anything, does that make you tired when you are going on those?"
"68","  Yeah.  Okay.  Have you noticed any, like soreness, any muscle specific fatigue as opposed to like falling asleep?"
"69","  Okay.  That has faded.  Okay.  You have any trouble falling asleep at night like when you actually try and go to sleep?"
"70","  Okay, sounds good.  All right.  Do you have like any specific diets that you are on? Where you like don't eat certain food groups or anything like that?"
"71"," Yeah."
"72","  Yeah, okay, but you are not like a vegetarian or vegan."
"73","  Okay, no vegetarian or vegan or anything like that?"
"74","  Okay and have you noticed any, like, unusual or easy, like bruising that you have been having?"
"75","  No.  Okay.  It sounds good and then this might seem like a question little bit out of nowhere, but on a similar being, have you noticed any differences in your bowel movements, any like dark coloring or red when you are going to bathroom?"
"76","  No?  Okay.  It sounds like you have been feeling a little bit tired for the last six months mostly, you are seeing that that you fall asleep sort of unintentionally when you are home in the afternoon after work."
"77","  But no trouble sleeping otherwise.  You are not snoring or anything. Okay.  How has your mood been?"
"78"," Not bad."
"79","  Yeah, okay.  Sounds good and it sounds like you still, you love playing with your grandkids and like walks are good.  (Laughs) Okay.  Sounds good.  Is there anything else that has been concerning you that we have not talked about yet?"
"80","  Okay.  So, I think what might make sense to me and you let me know what you think is definitely getting another A1c because usually, we do that every three months for someone with diabetes if the A1c has not been super stable and yours has been sort of creeping up, so it will be helpful to get another check on that and see how it is doing.  So, I mean coming in for labs or going somewhere for labs.  And I think at the same time, it might be nice, we have sort of a panel of lab tests that we often do for fatigue and they will check.  These do not seem super likely with you, but just to check to make sure.  We will check like what the iron levels in your blood are because that carries oxygen that can make you tired.  And the other thing that often we can check, although I did not ask you the questions for is your thyroid function.  Because that can make you a little bit tired.  Have you noticed any weight gain in the last six months?"
"81","  No, okay. Any like hair loss?"
"82","  Okay.  Yeah.  Not like unusual, okay. And any like, times where you are feeling cold when other people around you are not?  Anything like that?"
"83","  (Laughs) Okay.  Okay.  So, those are sort of the main things.  I think you also had on your chart hyperlipidemia.  Does sound familiar?"
"84","  It means like high cholesterol often?"
"85","  Yeah, okay.  If you would be okay with that, it might be worth also checking just your blood levels like the cholesterol and the lipids and see how they are doing."
"86","  Just because if you are getting your blood drawn, you can just sort of do those all.  And then I think the last thing that would probably be a good idea, because your A1c was up three months ago, and it does not sound like your medications changed at all at that time, I am too early if I assume to know about the dosages of these medications, but I will go like (laughs).  We will either increase the meds that you are on or we will add a new one.  I will have to talk to the doctor about the exact change that we would make."
"87","  But does that make sense to you?  All those things?"
"88","  Okay.  Is there anything else ?"
"89","  Okay.  So, we will start with those tests and then hopefully can schedule a followup shortly after you get those tests and discuss the results and what, if any sort of things we do about them.  Does that make sense?"
"90","  All right. So that will be the plan for now.  Yeah, unless you have any questions about any of that, I will let you go."
"91","  Okay.  All right.  Well, it was very nice to meet you."
"92","  All right.  Enjoy your afternoon."
"93","  Bye."
