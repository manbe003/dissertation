"1","  Yes.  I just found out the mute button there.  How are you doing?"
"2","  Oh, Freddie, everybody calls me Freddie, that's fine."
"3","  Well, basically I'm just running out of steam.  I’m really tired these days and I know it's related to my diabetes and I'm supposed to come in every four months or so and it's been over a year now.  But I wanted to change providers and get focused on making sure my diabetes is under control and keeping up with my grandkids basically since I'm running out of energy when I try to keep up with a now 8, 5, and 2.  So…"
"4","  Yeah.  The 8-year-old things that she is in charge and of course the 5-year-old just goes along with everything, it’s only worked up for him and, but the 2-year-old nobody knows what she is going to do and just is probably going to be a problem, though.  So…"
"5","  Oh, I don't know how to do that, but I'll do that, try, yes, that'll be good."
"6","  Well, how to I begin, well then, when I'm at work for example, I just in the afternoons I find myself dozing off, and I really don't want to be taking naps at work, you know.  I've tried to take, to get a little bit more exercise, I've been taking a couple of walks during the week while I'm at work and that sometimes kind of perks me up, but by the time I get home, I'm just about ready to call it a day and the grandkids are already there because basically my wife is the babysitter when my daughter is at work and stuff.  So…"
"7","  So is that's when I want to have that energy and that's when I got the least I think."
"8","  Oh, pretty well, I wish I could get some more sleep actually, it's I seem to wake up tired and go to bed tired."
"9","  I think sometimes she says, I think she is the one that snores though actually it's…"
"10","  Kind of, I don't know, sometimes you know you're stopped up or something, I suppose everybody snore sometimes.  So…"
"11","  Well, I guess, I'm just here to see if everything is okay and if how I can get back on track with, I mean, the last numbers I have for a year ago and I was 7.4, but I've been keeping track of my glucose levels and stuff, it's generally about 200 or so.  It was 215 this morning."
"12","  I only do that twice a week though, so it's…"
"13","  Well, I guess it's just kind of get reestablished with…"
"14","  Yeah and making sure that we can keep things at a steady level and I really don't want to make a whole bunch of changes."
"15","  I mean, what can I change really is, as much I'm doing everything I can.  So…"
"16","  Well, we talked about and I know I have to be careful about diet, but the last, one of the main things that we do as a family is on the weekend, and so we have big fried chicken Sunday dinner and everybody brings you know potato salad and all other accoutrements and stuff and we have a really good family day on Sunday.  And my last provider wanted me to give up fried chicken and I'm saying, you know like that's not really kind of me, that's not going to be possible.  So I'm sure I'll eat lesser or whatever, but there are some things that, you know, you can't change really."
"17","  That sounds like a good start.  I don't know whether the changes I can make really, I mean, what is…"
"18","  I take the meds, metformin and glipizide twice a day, so morning and evening."
"19","  So one other things I've tried to do lately is do a little bit less snacking because I think you know I was having a little bit too much in between meals.  So…"
"20","  Well, I don't know.  If, as long as I don't end up on insulin, that's my main concern as far as the meds are concerned.  What other choices are there besides that?  If we could adjust those, the metformin or the glipizide, sure that would be it."
"21","  I don't know, I'm kind of, kind of surprised about the blood pressure thing.  That's like the first time I heard about that.  I know I got high cholesterol, but nobody told me I needed to have blood medicine before.  So, it doesn’t seem quite right."
"22","  No, sorry."
"23","  So, I need to come into the office today to do this instead of on the…"
"24","  I don't think so."
"25","  I'm kind of dubious about going out and hanging around pharmacies in the age of COVID, it's that the same kind of cuff that somebody else is using there, it seems like it would be, so…"
"26","  And can I make an appointment to come in or something when I can get away from work?"
"27","  If that's what we need to do to get my meds on track without getting on insulin it sounds like a good idea to me."
"28","  I think that must be some, well it's a note from my, the old provider, it's -- when I was first diagnosed with the diabetes, eight years ago, my feet hurt and it was hard to stand on it, but the meds they put me on changed all that and I haven’t had that problem for…"
"29","  Yeah, long while."
"30","  So…"
"31","  Except that sleeping in the afternoon usually starts in the morning after breakfast, so it's pretty much sleepy all day long and then really tired from time-to-time."
"32","  I don't know, when I first wake up, I'm not really awake.  I don't know.  I don't think so."
"33","  So, I wake up about the time I get my first cup of coffee and start waking myself up, I guess, yeah."
"34","  Yeah, I don't know.  I just feel kind of self-conscious.  Walks are fine if you are a couple and you're strolling along, but if you're just a man on your own, it's -- unless you're jogging or something, what are you doing?  What you -- out there all by yourself for?  Are you up to no good or what?  So I don't know.  I don't really like just walking around and so we sometimes, I just take those walks around the facilities that we operated ______ and well, believe me, you can put a lot of miles there on the floors inside when the weather is bad outside. "
"35","  Well, you know, it's a real change, it's not the world it used to be, that one that anybody goes outside at all anymore."
"36","  Well, every day on the news somebody else gets shot, mostly by the police.  So if it isn’t the police, it's some kind of nut with a gun that's out anywhere, it could be the shopping mall, it could be the grocery store, it could be the old folk's home, it could be the elementary school.  There is -- it's crazy, it's crazy.  That's what I thought."
"37","  Okay.  I was sorry I'm getting off track, but…"
"38","  Any way."
"39","  Okay.  Can we talk freely while we wait, or should we talk later?"
"40","  Okay, that would be good."
"41","  Hello, we're back?"
"42","  Well, I don't know what happened, but that's the way it works and the worldwide mess they call the internet."
"43","  Looks like we're back together anyway."
"44","  Pretty good.  I'm trying to take everything in stride and look for, you know, the positives.  The main thing is, just not being able to keep up with the grandkids is wearing me down and so that's…"
"45","  As far as I was concerned because I guess that's my number one concern.  I mean, in general, I am 60 years old now.  A few years from now I'll be retiring, I was thinking about it and, or what, you know, I am old, what's happening?  Will -- is this the end coming or so a lot of those things are kind of weighing on me a little bit I guess.  But, I don't know, I try to take it in stride and just amazing.  What I'd like is to have a little more energy."
"46","  I don't know.  I kind of haven’t thought of those things before.  I thought I was sleeping okay.  I tried to exercise more and usually that does go good.  But…"
"47","  Yeah, yeah, if I can."
"48","  Oh, it's just I got a really busy day already, I mean I work full time.  So it's not or I am not sure how to fit that into the schedule."
"49","  I don't know.  It's kind of hard.  My wife does the cooking and other than that I just grab what's fit and easy and good, you know.  It's I guess…"
"50","  Well, I try to, you know, hydrate.  I have, well a lot of coffee in the morning, but then I generally have a large soda with lunch and again I'll drink large soda at dinnertime, I don't drink alcohol, beers, stuff like that much, maybe once a year or so, if there's some kind of event."
"51","  Well, I like them all.  It's -- I don't like the diet taste so much, so I use regular soda.  So in coke actually it's hard to tell the difference.  Dr. Pepper is like root beer.  And I'm not so sure about the Sprite and ______."
"52","  They seem to have – gives the energy?"
"53","  I guess it, yeah."
"54","  I guess so, yeah, I'll try that and see if that works.  Maybe have some coffee instead."
"55","  Just cream and sugar."
"56","  Well, it's not so much, it's not cream, it's half-and-half, it's you know the healthy one what you call it, just a couple of spoons of sugar usually."
"57","  I guess so.  I mean, I guess I can try, just to, you know, you open the thing up and then it is just going to go bad if you don't finish it off.  Maybe, you know, loses all of its carbonation and so…"
"58","  I guess, what you suggest about, you know, change in the dose of the meds would be one possibility and then…"
"59","  Change in the dose of the meds, did you hear that part?"
"60","  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's what you were talking about before.  I was thinking that might be possible."
"61","  Yeah, okay, well, I'll keep that log of the blood sugar a couple of times a week, so yeah."
"62","  Okay, yeah, I'll try to remember to write that down."
"63","  Yeah, I guess so, it sounds okay to me."
"64","  Well thanks for your help, Anne, and so I look forward to seeing you more as a new provider."
"65","  I don't know, I'm just kind of overwhelmed by the whole thing.  I need to just sit down put it into perspective, I guess.  But…"
"66","  Okay, well thanks again."
