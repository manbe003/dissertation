"1","  Hi, Freddy, how are you doing?  Have you clicked on your bottom left hand part of your screen, there should be something that says mute down there.  Because I can’t hear you yet?  There you go."
"2","  Yes, great."
"3","  Well, it’s nice to meet you, Freddy.  Before we get started could you just confirm your full name for me?"
"4","  Okay, and do you go by Freddy or Mr. Jones?"
"5","  Okay, sounds good.  And like can you just confirm your date of birth with me?"
"6","  Alright, and what’s your gender?"
"7","  Yeah, that sounds good.  Okay.  Thanks for sharing all that information with me.  So, before we get started for all of our E-health care visits, I just want to double check where you are taking this appointment from, right now?"
"8","  No, are you are at home or you somewhere public?"
"9","  Yeah, great.  And is there anyone else in the room with you?"
"10","  Okay, we just like to ask to make sure that you have like your privacy and stuff before talking on medical information."
"11","  Yes, you have a full house."
"12","  Okay, great.  Well, I saw that the reason for your visit was to talk a little bit about diabetes, health care and then some fatigue, like tiredness, you have been experiencing.  Do you want to tell me a little bit about that?"
"13","  Yeah.  Okay, great.  And is there anything else that you want to talk about besides your diabetes today?"
"14","  Yeh.  It’s a good question."
"15","  Yeah, for sure, we will definitely get into that.  Have you been feeling a little bit more tired recently?"
"16","  When do you think you noticed that change?"
"17","  Yeah, and do you feel like you need to take a nap, like you are tired or you just feel kind of more low energy?"
"18","  Hmm.  Do you ever feel like shortness of breath or tired in that sense?"
"19","  Okay, okay, so more like sleepy, just kind of exhausted by the end of the day, low energy."
"20","  Okay.  Have you noticed any other changes?"
"21","  Okay.  So, let’s talk a little bit more about your diabetes.  Do you keep track of your blood sugars?"
"22","  Okay, great.  Well, I am glad that you are keeping track of your blood sugars, that's really important.  So, it’s about 215 this morning.  Is that normal for you?"
"23","  Bless you."
"24","  Is 215 pretty normal for you?"
"25","  Okay.  And do you check your blood sugar when you are fasting, like not eating?"
"26","  Okay, perfect.  Great.  So this is after you have slept all night, you check it in the morning and then you have breakfast after?"
"27","  Okay.  So, do you know what normal or kind of goal blood sugar would be?"
"28","  What a good goal would be, like a normal?"
"29","  Well, you should be like a little bit lower than that.  Closer to like may be under 140 is what we consider normal."
"30","  But as close as you can get to that is good.  You know, we don’t expect it to change overnight or anything, but that’s kind of a better target maybe to have in mind, than 100, I mean than 200."
"31","  Okay, so, you know you mentioned maybe having to change medications.  I think that having a blood glucose level around 200 pretty consistently definitely would be considered high, so, I think that you might be a good conversation to have about changing some medications."
"32","  Yeah, there are certainly a lot of options out there."
"33","  So, I am glad we are having time to talk about it today.  So, before we get into kind of the medication options, I also wanted to ask if you had your A1c checked recently?  You know what that means?"
"34","  Okay, yeah, the last time I see here is in 2021.  Do you think that you have had it checked since then?"
"35","  Yeah."
"36","  Okay.  So I think that we should probably have that checked."
"37","  Yeah, that’s alright.  I know people have been really, you know, with COVID, it’s been so hard to get in to the doctor.  So you know, if we can set up a time for you to come and get that checked pretty soon, that would be good, because that helps to give us a sense of kind of your average blood sugar level over the past several months, so it can be a good measure for us to track how your diabetes control is going."
"38","  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean it’s definitely, you're not going to be 100% safe going in, so I think you're going to have to kind of weigh the risks and balances.  So, you know, if you wear a mask and if you are vaccinated, I think that you'll probably be pretty safe going for just to get your A1c checked.  It would be relatively fast, but like you said, that you don’t want to bring COVID home to your family, it’s totally understandable and I think that with you blood sugar levels we do know that we do need to make some changes anyways.  So, it’s not an emergency that you go get your A1c checked or anything like that but."
"39","  We also don’t want to put off your health needs until the end of COVID because we don’t know when that is going to be.  So, definitely something to think about but it will be up to you to decide it if that is the choice you want to make and that being said, I think, your grandkids can get vaccinated if they are over 5, so a couple of them could probably get the vaccine soon, which should be great.  May give them a little more protection."
"40","  Yeah.  So, let’s go back to your medications that you are taking for diabetes.  How often do you miss a dose?"
"41","  Okay, yeah, that’s pretty common to miss one here and there.  What do you do to keep track of when you have to take your medications?"
"42","  Okay.  That sounds like it’s working pretty well for you."
"43","  Have you ever noticed that, like, have you ever checked your blood sugar and it’s been really low, like under 100?"
"44","  Okay, because we also, we don’t want to give you too much medications and then you get really low blood sugar, because that can be dangerous."
"45","  Yeah.  Okay.  So, it does not sound like you are having any really low blood sugars ever.  Okay.  And do you ever check your blood sugars after you eat?"
"46","  Yeah, okay, because basically what we have you on is metformin, so this is kind of a longer acting medication and that’s to help with your baseline levels of your blood sugar and then the what’s it, the glipizide, control yeh, so that is the one that you take with meals and that is short acting.  So, that is just to control the blood sugar spikes that happen with your meals."
"47","  So, that is why you have two of them.  So, there are a few options."
"48","  Oh, okay.  You don’t take it with all your meals?"
"49","  Yeah, well the metformin is good to take twice a day and then we usually recommend the glipizide or the Glucotrol, that you take that with meals twice a day at least."
"50","  Yeah, so do you think maybe we should try that and then see how your diabetes is, see how like the blood sugar is controlled?"
"51","  Okay, so, can u tell me back to me what you think the plan is going forward?"
"52","  Okay, great so, yeah, I think when you get your A1c checked, it’s not going to reflect the changes in medication yet because that measures over a long period of time, so don’t be surprised if the A1c is still a little bit high, okay."
"53","  And then we will definitely want you to keep checking your blood sugars pretty regularly."
"54","  Okay, and can you make sure that you write them down and keep kind of a journal of what they have been in the past, and like the upcoming couple of weeks."
"55","  Okay, yeah, that would be great.  Okay, so you will come to get your A1c checked, you will keep a log of your glucose, blood sugar measurements, and you will take the glipizide twice a day right before your meals."
"56","  Do you have any questions about that plan?"
"57","  Okay and then so it sounds like your last provider was a little bit worried about your diet.  I am sure they talked to you about the importance of having a good diet to help with diabetes control and that is true."
"58","  Yeah, that is nice, definitely makes it hard.  Just try your best and you know eat healthy foods and exercise.  It sounds like you have your grandchildren around.  I am sure that they are you know keeping you pretty active, but we do know that diet and exercise does help control blood sugar as well.  So, you know, well, it sounds like you didn’t like them telling you that you cut back on fried chicken, it is still a good idea to, you know, pay attention to your diet and try to eat as healthy as you can."
"59","  Oh, that does sound delicious.  Okay and then few other things while I have you here for this appointment, although I want to see you again soon just to follow up on these changes that we are making.  Have you been, has someone talked to you about kind of the risk of peripheral neuropathy with diabetes?  So, like your feet feeling kind of numb?"
"60","  So, sometimes if you have diabetes for a long time, like you can, the nerves in peripheral, which is basically like all your extremities in your body, so like your feet.  They begin to lose some sensation.  So, people who have diabetes for a long time, we would like to make sure that their sensation isn’t going away in their feet."
"61","  Have you had that checked recently?"
"62","  Well, that’s good.  You can do it yourselves.  You can, kind of, poke it with like a toothpick and if you can feel it, you can have your wife or someone do it for you.  It is pretty simple check that way, but you can also come into the doctor's office and we can do it too."
"63","  Yeah, yeah.  It’s just to make sure you can still feel properly and then it gives you a chance to look at your feet too and make sure there is not any injuries that you didn't notice."
"64","  Okay.  Yeah, its always good to double check.  Okay, so, yeah, I think that we will get this A1c.  You will start taking the glipizide twice daily."
"65","  And you will come and get your A1c checked and we will kind of check back in after I get those results, so that we can make a plan going forward.  Okay."
"66","  Okay.  I know we talked about a lot.  Do you have any questions about that plan?"
"67","  Okay.  It was really nice to meet you."
"68","  Thanks, bye Freddy."
"69","  You may just press leave."
