"1","  Hi, Tom.  I think you’re muted Tom."
"2","  Yes, I can hear you now."
"3","  Good.  It’s nice to meet you virtually.  My name is Kate ___, I am a first-year medical student and I’ll be chatting with you today."
"4","  So, I saw in your chart that you have some concerns for COVID possibly.  Why don’t you walk me through what’s been going on and what brought you to the clinic today?"
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Okay.  So, you had a slight fever, it sounds like some upper respiratory symptoms.  Have you been around anyone with confirmed positive or tested positive for COVID?"
"7","  Okay, and have you ever had COVID before?"
"8","  Okay.  Let’s see, have you gotten your vaccinations for COVID?"
"9","  Okay, all right and then besides COVID or potentially COVID kind of making you ill, how is your health been otherwise, anything else going on?"
"10","  Yeah, I’m sorry to hear that, sounds like you’ve been a little under the weather lately, okay.  So, does this illness feel similar to what you felt with previous colds before or is there something that feels different that kind of prompted you to come in today that you want me to be aware of?"
"11","  Okay, yeah that makes a lot of sense, has your girlfriend been ill at all?"
"12","  Okay, okay.  So, next I’m just going to ask a couple of symptom questions just to make sure I’m being thorough and not missing anything.  You mentioned you have fatigue and fever and some cough, have you had a runny nose at all?"
"13","  Okay.  What about a sore throat?"
"14","  Okay and then have you had any trouble breathing?"
"15","  Okay, any chest pain?"
"16","  Has your stomach been upset at all?"
"17","  Okay, any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?"
"18","  Okay, all right and then any headache?"
"19","  Have you noticed a change in like smell or taste recently?"
"20","  Okay, all right.  Let’s see and have you taken anything to make yourself feel better like any over-the-counter medication?"
"21","  DayQuil.  Have that helped at all?"
"22","  Okay and then Tom if you don’t mind me asking, what do you do for work.  Are you working right now?"
"23","  General laborer, okay.  Are you around a lot of people at the construction site you work at?"
"24","  Okay, all right and then do you take any other medications for any other purposes?"
"25","  Okay.  So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize everything, you’ve had a fever, a cough, some fatigue and just given the pandemic and everything going on, your girlfriend looked concerned and prompted you to come into the clinic to get some COVID testing, does that sound right?"
"26","  Okay.  Am I missing anything at all or is there anything else you wanted to bring up?"
"27","  Okay.  So, I think it’s very reasonable to go get a COVID test.  So, we’ll get that ordered for you and also encourage you to potentially get back to me after this illness is over, but we can discuss that at a later time and then in my opinion I think it’s very reassuring that you are not having any shortness of breath or trouble breathing or chest pain and just given this time a year I think it could totally be reasonable that maybe you caught some sort of other virus or maybe there is something else going around, but it will be good to just double-check to make sure it’s not COVID and rule that out if possible."
"28","  Do you have any questions for me, Tom?"
"29","  Okay.  So, we’ll get that test and then I’d encourage you in the meantime if it’s possible to isolate at home.  Can I ask what your current living situation is like?"
"30","  Okay.  Is it possible to I guess sleep in separate bedrooms or have her in one part of the apartment or house and you in another one while we get this illness figured out?"
"31","  Yeah, I think just to be cautious at least until we get the test results and maybe the worst of your illness is over and then I would encourage you to continue taking DayQuil and just kind of let the illness run its course and then just some signs and symptoms to look out for would be trouble breathing, any chest pain, kind of anything more serious like that and then I would either call the clinic again or maybe try to go to the ER if you feel like you’re getting significantly worse, but right now are you in any pain at all or is that just discomfort from the illness?"
"32","  Okay.  Well, it was really great chatting with you Tom.  If you don’t have any more questions, feel free to hop off the Zoom call and I hope you feel better soon."
"33","  All right.  Good bye."
