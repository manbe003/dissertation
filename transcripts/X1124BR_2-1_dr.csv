"1","  Hello?  It appears that you are muted."
"2","  Hi, hello.  My name is…"
"3","  How's it going on?"
"4","  Pretty good.  Okay so my name is Jesus.  I'm a medical student and I'm going to be doing your telehealth visit today.  What is your name?"
"5","  Tom Johnson, okay what is your, can you confirm your date of birth for me please?"
"6","  Yes."
"7","  That's not the date of birth that I have on file for Thomas Johnson?"
"8","  A different birthday."
"9","  Oh, okay, okay.  So I unfortunately I can't proceed with the visit until I confirm your date of birth just for privacy, essentially just to protect your own privacy. "
"10","  Yeah, so unfortunately we have a different birthday on file.  When did you say your birthday was in?"
"11","  January 45, oh okay.  You are Thomas Johnson right?"
"12","  How old are you?"
"13","  58, okay.  Maybe we have the wrong birthday on file.  What is your address?"
"14","  In Beacon Hill.  Do you know your street number and your house number?"
"15","  Okay.  What are you, it's okay, I guess we can proceed with the visit.  So tell me more, what brings you in to this appointment?"
"16","  Okay.  So you said you have a cold?"
"17","  Tell me more about the symptoms."
"18","  Okay.  Have you been checking your temperature?"
"19","  Okay.  Alright and then how long have you been feeling these symptoms?"
"20","  Like two weeks?"
"21","  Couple of weeks, okay.  Have you tried taking any medications to try to make it better?"
"22","  Okay.  And does it help?"
"23","  Okay.  So yeah, it sounds like you've had some like cold symptoms, temperature, you're taking Dayquil and has helped.  Do you have any other type of symptoms?"
"24","  Yeah, or just anything else, any other, just anything else?"
"25","  No, okay.  And you're just concerned that this might be COVID?"
"26","  Okay.  Have you been able to get a COVID test?"
"27","  No, okay.  Can you hear me?"
"28","  Okay.  And so you haven’t been able to get a COVID test you said?"
"29","  Okay.  Is there any COVID sites, any COVID testing like in your neighborhood, in your community where you live in Beacon Hill?"
"30","  Okay, and so it sounds like your girlfriend is pressuring you to go, does that mean that you don't want to go?"
"31","  Okay.  And when you say that you're on the fence about COVID, can you tell me more about that?"
"32","  Okay.  What kind of things are you concerned with?"
"33","  Oh, okay.  So you haven’t been vaccinated against COVID?"
"34","  Okay.  But you are worried about that you might have it then?"
"35","  Okay.  So I guess the best way that we can confirm if this is COVID or not is by doing a COVID test."
"36","  Okay?  Are you willing to do a COVID test?"
"37","  Okay.  So what I can do is, I can, I have your pharmacy on file, and what I can do is, I can go ahead and order you a COVID test at your pharmacy and I’m, you’re able to go do it whenever you have time in the short near future and then we can get the results and then we can notify you if it is COVID."
"38","  Okay.  Do you have any questions about that?"
"39","  I see that you’re also, I see that you’re also requesting, just from the reason for your visit, you're also requesting to get like a just a general checkup?"
"40","  10 years, okay.  Why is that?"
"41","  Okay."
"42","  Yeah, it happens like you know just time flies and it just slips out.  What I recommend since I do have, I do have time today, so I think maybe we can go ahead and just request or are you able to come into the clinic?  I would love to schedule you in for just a general checkup."
"43","  You wouldn’t be against it, okay.  Sounds like you're a busy man?"
"44","  Yeah, okay.  If you want, what I can do in the meantime is, I can go ahead and just order more, I can just, since you're going to go to the pharmacy, you're going to do the COVID test there, I can just go ahead and just order this general screening tests as part of your physical and then once we get those results, like we can go ahead and give you a call and we can schedule you to come in, in person, because I'd just like to do just a general, you know, this physical in person and then go over the results with you from all the labs today. "
"45","  Is there any questions about that one?"
"46","  Okay.  So essentially what, the labs that I'm going to be ordering is of course the COVID test and we're just going to do this general screenings, so I would like to test your, I'd like to screen you for diabetes just to see, diabetes is very common these days and then also we'd like to screen you for high cholesterol, we'd like to just screen your kidney function, your liver function.  And then, have you, I know you're kind of hesitant with getting the COVID vaccine?"
"47","  Okay.  As just a part of your general, like a general physical, I think it would be a good idea, I mean once we get, once we confirm, once you start to feel better and we confirm that you are COVID negative or if you do have COVID once you recover then I’d recommend getting vaccinated against COVID and I'm happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have about that."
"48","  Yeah.  Okay, do you have any questions?"
"49","  Okay.  And is that okay with this plan then?"
"50","  Okay, so yeah, like I said we'll do, I'll go ahead and order those labs to your local pharmacies and then once we get those results, we'll call you and we'll try to schedule in for an appointment in person and then we can go over that, that’s it."
"51","  Okay?"
"52","  Alright, any other last minute questions?"
"53","  No, okay.  Alright, so I guess that concludes our visit.  If you don't have any questions and I'm looking forward to meeting you in real life."
"54","  Okay, you can go ahead and exit the visit.  Thank you."
