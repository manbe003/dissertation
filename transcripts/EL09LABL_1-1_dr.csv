"1","  Hi Tom. How are you doing today?"
"2","  Well, thank you for meeting me over telehealth today."
"3","  How are you doing?"
"4","  Great.  My name is Nicole. I am going to be your doctor for the visit today.  Before we jump into things can you confirm your full name with me?"
"5","  Okay and do you like to go by Tom or Mr. Johnson?"
"6","  Okay, great nice to meet you Tom.  And what's your date of birth?"
"7","  Okay, and what's your gender?"
"8","  Male.  Thank you for sharing all that with me.  Is there anyone else in your room with you at home?"
"9","  Okay, so just a reminder everything we talk about is confidential today unless you tell me anything that makes it seem like you are going to harm yourself or others. Otherwise all the normal kind of interactions of doctor's office apply, even on an e-visit like this one okay?"
"10","  Okay, so I saw in chart that you are concerned about COVID, is that why you have your appointment today?"
"11","  Okay.  Can you tell me a little bit more about when it started?"
"12","  Yeah, that's a smart idea for sure.  How are you feeling right now?"
"13","  Okay. And you think that that helped?"
"14","  Okay, great.  Do you feel overall like you are getting better or worse or you are staying about the same with your cough?"
"15","  Okay.  It is about the same for the past week?"
"16","  When you cough is there anything that comes out, is it productive or is it more like a dry cough?  Sorry, I think I missed that.  Can you still hear me okay Tom?"
"17","  Oh, hi I can hear you again there, sorry.  I think you cut out for a second."
"18","  Okay. And when did you first notice your fever?"
"19","  Okay.  And do you know what temperature it was when it started?"
"20","  Okay. And do you feel like you still have the fever now?"
"21","  Okay.  Do you have any other symptoms like chills or night sweats?"
"22","  Okay.  What about other things going on, other changes you've noticed in the past week or so?"
"23","  Okay.  Before this happened, you were around anyone that had COVID, maybe like about a week before?"
"24","  Okay.  Yeah, it's hard to know sometimes.  And have you tested for COVID since you noticed your symptoms?"
"25","  Okay.  And you mentioned your girlfriend is a little bit worried about getting COVID.  Has she been tested at all?"
"26","  Oh, okay, great.  And then you've been vaccinated?"
"27","  Okay. Okay, so it is definitely possible that you have COVID, I think it does make sense to get a test, does that sound like a good plan to you?"
"28","  Okay.  Is there anything else that you are wondering about?"
"29","  No, okay.  So I think that we can send you a COVID test or you can come in person to get one, is that possible for you to or do you have a preference to have one sent out to your house or to come in person to one of the hospitals to get that done?"
"30","  Oh, hi yeah, I think you just cut out for a second there?"
"31","  Okay, no worries.  So I was just wondering if you would like to have a test sent to your house or come in person to have a test done?"
"32","  Oh, could you say that again, sorry."
"33","  Yeah, they definitely are offering them at a lot of like public service places, so it is possible for you to get one yourself if you want to.  Do you know what to do if it is positive?"
"34","  So if you don’t have any symptoms that are really bad you actually don’t have to go see a doctor.  You can stay at home and just stay isolated from the other people in your house if that's possible, so don’t be in the same room as other people and wearing a mask helps a lot."
"35","  Okay, does that make sense?"
"36","  And then if you were to get more sick like you felt like you couldn’t breathe or you couldn’t get like enough air in your lungs and/or you had a really high fever, that would be a good time to call us back here at the office or even go to the emergency room if you feel like you are really struggling to breathe."
"37","  You have questions about when would be a good time to go to an emergency room?"
"38","  Okay.  So it sounds like a good plan for you would to be a COVID test and then if it is positive you are going to isolate yourself into a room in your house, so you don’t spread the COVID to other people.  Is that going to be possible for you?"
"39","  Okay.  I know it is not the best, some of most fun thing to do, but it will definitely help protect other people in the house and in your community."
"40","  Okay. Well it was so nice to meet you today Tom.  Thanks for taking the time to go over everything with me.  If your COVID test comes back negative and you are continuing to have symptoms, is it possible for you to make another appointment and we can check in, in a couple of days if you feel like your symptoms haven’t got better yet?"
"41","  Okay, great.  Thanks so much Tom."
"42","  Have a good afternoon."
"43","  Bye."
