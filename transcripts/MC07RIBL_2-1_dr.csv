"1","  Hi, Freddie, can you hear me okay?"
"2","  Okay, I can hear you.  My name is _______.  How would you like me to refer to you during this visit?"
"3","  Great.  Well, it is nice to meet you.  I am sorry it is over a computer screen.  Tell me a little bit about what brings you in today."
"4","  Okay.  Yeah, I see that in your chart, and I see you have at least been getting some hemoglobin A1c's done.  So that is great."
"5","  Tell me what concerns you about your diabetes."
"6","  Yeah, I hear you.  It is kind of just like kind of vague symptom that could be a lot of different things."
"7","  Yeah, I get this is concerning thing to you.  So I think it could be a number of things that I want to ask about, but first in terms of your diabetes, how are you currently taking your medications?  I see you are on metformin and glipizide.  Are you taking both of those?"
"8","  Okay, great.  And then I saw that you got a hemoglobin A1c done recently.  Are you familiar with that number?"
"9","  Yeah, so it is 7.9 which has been slowly creeping up over the years.  Our goal is always kind of around 7, but it is generally pretty good.  I think there is some more work we can do in terms of glucose management.  But if you have been feeling rundown, I kind of want to focus on that symptom if that is alright with you."
"10","  When did you first start feeling like you were a little bit more rundown?"
"11","  Okay.  Did anything happen?"
"12","  Oh, that is great."
"13","  Um, um."
"14","  Yeah.  Had you ever experienced something like that before?"
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Okay.  And when you are feeling kind of rundown, were you noticing any other symptoms in your body?"
"17","  Okay.  Any like chest pain or chest tightness?"
"18","   Okay, any feeling like you just like could not catch your breath?"
"19","  Feeling like you might pass out at all."
"20","   Okay.  So really just kind of feeling more tired than usual."
"21","  Okay.  So, it seems like this has been going on for a couple of months now.  Have you noticed anything else over that time period?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay, so peeing quite a bit more."
"24","  And when you say peeing more, it can mean a lot of different things to different people.  So, are you peeing larger volumes when you go or are you making more trips to the bathroom, or both?"
"25","   Okay.  So, you feel like the volume is increased and you are also having to go a lot more?"
"26","   Okay. Umm.  Alright.  Anything else that you have noticed over the past? Umm, past couple of months or so?"
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Yeah.  So when you were first diagnosed with diabetes, do you remember kind of having this increase in urination similar to you are having now?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Yeah, okay.  So maybe that symptom is similar to something you have experienced before, that kind of now also happening with more fatigue."
"31","  Okay.  Umm.  Is there anything else you want to make sure we talk about during this visit other than kind of this feeling run down and your diabetes?"
"32","  Okay.  So, I have a few thoughts.  I am just going to throw it out there and then we can kind of talk about what you are thinking."
"33","  So I see that you got an A1c recently, but I do not have any other labs for you.  Have you had any other labs done elsewhere that just are not in our records?"
"34","  Okay.  Alright.  So cholesterol high, and did they do anything that looked at kidney function, do you?  Do you know that?"
"35","  Okay.  So, what I would like to try to do is, is get those records to see what was already done, so we are not repeating any labs that you have already had done, but kind of following up on those, so if your cholesterol was high and especially with folks who have diabetes, we like them to be on a statin.  Have you ever heard of a statin before?"
"36","  Yeah.  So, it is a medication that helps lower the cholesterol in your blood, a specific type of lipid known as LDL, which is, ""the bad cholesterol"" and it is a medication you take daily and since you are already used to taking medications daily, hopefully we could just time it with some of your other medications so it is not too much of a burden on you; and that can really help bring your cholesterol down to a healthy level and what we know that that does is reduces your risk for things like strokes and a heart attack over, you know, the coming years."
"37","  No, it is actually a really great medication for patients with diabetes to be on because we know that there is some overlap in, in how diabetes and high cholesterol affect the body."
"38","  So what do you think about that?"
"39","  Yeah.  The most common side effect is just having some muscle ache or fatigue and a bump in some liver values.  So the two things we do to check that are just follow up on your labs to make sure they are okay and just check in to see how you are doing."
"40","  Yeah, okay.  And I would want to check to see what your labs were to kind of help us figure out which one would be the best anyway.  So you think about it, and I will kind of do some more digging in your past lab work to see what might be best for you."
"41","  Okay.  And then I would also want to see, just because you have been feeling run down a little bit, what I would want to see is where your blood counts are at, so specifically your hemoglobin or hematocrit, because sometimes when people get anemic, it can make them feel a little bit more exhausted than normal."
"42","  Have you ever been anemic in the past?"
"43","  Okay.  Yeah.  So it is just something I would want to check if it has not already been checked recently, that would be a lab that we would do."
"44","  And then kind of the other big chunk of this is your diabetes.  So your A1c has been kind of increasing over the past couple of years and so I am kind of looking at your medications that you are already on and I think there is some room to go up, so we could definitely increase your metformin dose, umm.  What do you think about that?"
"45","  Hm, hm."
"46","  Yeah.  Is thereâ€¦., I guess what makes you hesitant to change it?"
"47","  Hmm."
"48","  Yeah.  There are some other medications that we could add, so it would likely involve, it would be a third medication to add in addition to the two you are already taking in, and so that is definitely an option.  Umm.  And so it really is up to you if you are, if you would  rather increase your metformin dose because there is room to increase on that and see how that works for you or we could start another medication to kind of help bring your A1c down a little bit better or you could do nothing, and you could maybe make sure you are getting really good nutrition to kind of help support your blood glucose and we could try that and recheck in three months."
"49","  Which of those options sound best to you?"
"50","  Yeah.  So well, let us see.  I know that you are hesitant about, a little bit worried about experiencing maybe some side effects from increasing it and most commonly that is nausea or vomiting, so people get some GI upset with metformin.  So what I recommend is it looks like you take it twice a day with meals, so why do not we double the dose in the morning with your meal and see how that goes and keep the dose at night the same?  And if that is going alright after a couple weeks, then we can double the dose at night too."
"51","  Will that work okay for you?"
"52","  Okay, yeah, well, you can choose.  If you would rather double it at night first, that is also fine. "
"53","  Okay.  So just to recap so far, so we have talked about increasing your metformin and then following up on the labs that you have already had done to kind of see maybe if a statin would be helpful, which is that medication we talked about and what other labs might be helpful just to make sure that everything is, is going okay."
"54","  Okay.  And then I do think, you know, nothing really replaces an in-person visit, and I think it would be nice at our next followup visit maybe in three months or so if we could try to do one in person so we could do an exam."
"55","  Oh, good.  Perfect.  That is great."
"56","  Oh, good. I am glad you are getting those.  Well, how does that plan that we have made so far sound to you?"
"57","  Okay.  Are there any questions that you have for me or things that we did not talk about that you want to make sure we get to?"
"58","  It is hard to say, I think.  You know, I want to see what lab work has already been done to see if there is maybe something specific going on that is causing that.  Umm, but I think what you are also describing, too, is sometimes when people get older, they start noticing, feeling a little bit more tired than usual.  So, it is possible it is aging, but I do not want to chalk it up to that yet.  You know like I want to make sure there is not something else going on that could be causing you to feel more run down.  How do you sleep at night?"
"59","  Have you ever been told that you snore?"
"60","  Okay.  And she never told you that like, sometimes you like breathe, kind of funny at night or anything like that."
"61","   Okay, what I was asking is sometimes people can develop sleep apnea where there are short pauses in breathing throughout the night and that can obviously lead to people feeling tired during the day, but it does not sound like there is a huge concern for that, but if we are kind of working up your lab work and nothing is coming up, we could certainly consider a sleep study later on down the line."
"62","  Oh, yeah."
"63","  Yeah. What about, have you had any unintended weight loss recently?"
"64","   Okay.  Alright.  Well, I am sorry that we cannot fix you feeling tired today or come up with a good answer yet.  I think we need to chip away at a few things and see kind of what comes up from the lab work once I review it and any other lab work we need to do."
"65","  Alright."
"66","  Um, um, take care."
