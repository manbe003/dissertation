"1","  Hi Mr. Jones.  How are you doing?  I think you are still on mute.  You are still on mute.  Do you see the little button at the bottom of your microphone?  At the bottom there is a bar and on the left hand side there is a little microphone, yeah."
"2","  Yup, I can hear you now."
"3","  It’s so nice ___.  I am glad you found the mouse that can move around but.  My name is Dr. Hummel and you see how to pronounce.  It’s nice to meet you, Mr. Jones.  Is there another name you would prefer to be called by or does Mr. Jones work?"
"4","  Okay, nice to meet you Freddie.  So I was reading a little bit about you in the chart, but kind of I want to hear from you what you wanted to accomplish today?"
"5","  Yeah."
"6","  I am glad you came in.  I know it has been hard with COVID to kind of keep appointments and you know, diabetes definitely is one of those things that could cause fatigue, but I would still like love to hear a little bit more about what has been going on to make sure, so I don’t focus on one thing and miss anything else, if that works?"
"7","  Yeah.  So, first off, can you tell me about type of diabetes you have."
"8","  Okay.  And what medications are you taking if any?"
"9","  Okay.  How often like say during one week would you - say you miss any of those medications?"
"10","  Okay, awesome.  That's great to hear.  And how often are you checking your sugars?"
"11","  Okay.  And you know about where they have been ranging?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Okay.  And what was it before like this recent period?"
"14","  Okay.  Alright.  So, you usually check those twice a day?  Correct?"
"15","  You said you check your sugar about two times a day."
"16","  Oh, twice a week.  Okay."
"17","  Okay, alright.  And have you had any increase in like urination or increased thirst?"
"18","  Okay.  And when you say, you are too fatigued, is that all the time or is that certain times of the day or after certain activities?"
"19","  Yeah."
"20","  Yeah, of course, I mean.  I can completely understand.  I don’t have grandkids of my own, but I understand wanting to be able to play with your grandchildren have that kind of energy.  Definitely I make sure we have that, so we can keep that important part of your life, you know, functional and do things.  How many meals a day would you say you eat?"
"21","  Okay.  Alright.  And when you feel fatigued, is it just lack of energy or is it like do you feel like dizzy at all or you feel like lightheaded?"
"22","  Yeah, understandable.  Are you able, how is sleeping at night for you?"
"23","  Do you have to wake up at all to use the bathroom."
"24","  Okay."
"25","  That's good.  And when you wake up in the morning, do you feel refreshed or are you still feeling kind of groggy?"
"26","  Okay, good.  Good.  Alright, well, I saw in your chart that your hemoglobin A1c has been going up a little bit.  Do you remember what that means?"
"27","  Yeah, so the hemoglobin A1c is kind of an average over three months of what your blood sugars have been, so a little bit longer period and that’s what we look at to see how you have been doing long term, so I think that with that increase and what you are describing to me it does not really seem like there is maybe much else you know, sounds like you have, you know, your ___ with the grandkids and you know, you can get sleep at night, so does seem like the diabetes could be one of the reasons you are feeling so fatigued, so I think I want to maybe increase your metformin a little bit, if that is okay with you and I have here that you take it twice a day, is that correct?"
"28","  Okay.  Taking the 500 mg tablets.  Alright.  So, I think we could increase that to 1000 mg twice a day.  If you think that works and then we could see where it goes from there.  I kind of want to see you back in probably a month or two to see how your kind of feeling after that, that could get your blood sugars under better control and that could help with these fatigue because it is mentioned that blood sugar gets a little bit out of control back and you know cause those to feel more tired than you usually would feel."
"29","  Yeah, so, I think, you know, we kind of watch out for, you know, just feeling you know if you got worse feeling more fatigued, if you are you know like increased thirst and those kinds of things, kind of those symptoms that it’s kind of doing too much but I think we could also do where we could also increase like maybe a morning dose and leave that afternoon dose we could titrate you up, so maybe only double in the morning and keep the evening dose the same too, so we could slowly step you up, so you would minimize those side effects too.  So, we wanted like just double all at once.  We could do maybe one week where you take two pills in the morning and one at night and then the following week, you could do the two and two pills."
"30","  If that works.  Just so that like you said kind of ease you into that and kind of minimize the side effects, so your body can like slowly get used to it."
"31","  Yeah.  Any other concerns or questions for me?"
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Yeah.  In reference I would ask a few more questions, I just kind of.  How has your mood been?"
"34","  Yeah."
"35","  Okay.  Good and any homesick feeling, very jittery or anything like that and you get really?"
"36","  Alright.  Good I think you know based on the information I have, I think this could be a little bit related to the diabetes, so I think we are going to hit that first and hopefully this will kind of alleviate some of those symptoms and you can feel, have more energy, but I will soon check in hear from you to see if you know, if it’s working and also to see if there is anything else we can talk about.  I also want to talk of one thing at a time, because you know, I think, this is a good starting point, but I think this could be one of the reasons that you are feeling still fatigued, so I think starting with some medication changes and going from there _____ that sounds amenable to you."
"37","  Alright.  Well, I can send in a new prescription and I guess that we can start off with that, starting of with one week where you do just a 1000 in the morning, 500 at night and then the second week change to 1000 and 1000.  I will have it all written down."
"38","  Yeah, and like I said, please call if you feel, you know like if you are feeling lightheaded or if you are feeling anything like nausea, those are the kind of things that we look forward with the metformin, we don’t think that's going to happen, but you know if your body, the first time we put you on them kind of counteracted to change.  I think using it will be best, but please do let us know and we can think about our solutions."
"39","  It was great to see you Freddie now, also bring it on if  you know checking maybe in one to two months to see how it’s going if that works."
"40","  Alright.  Any other questions?"
"41","  Alright.  Well thanks so much Freddie and I will send that in with the instructions.  Okay."
"42","  Yeah.  Alright.  Have a good day."
