"1","  Hi there.  Is this Tom?  I can't see you very well Tom.  There we go, perfect, I think you are on mute as well.  All right, I can see you well, I just can't hear you, I think you got to un-mute yourself.  Do you see the mic, there should be a microphone button if you just hit that.  If you go to the, it's should be in the lower left corner of your screen."
"2","  Okay, all right.  Let's see."
"3","  Zoom is always little challenging, there you go."
"4","  Yeah, yeah, no we got it all worked out.  Well I am Houston I am soon Dr. Houston, I'll be talking to you today about you health what brings you here but how are you doing today to start out with?"
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Okay all right, well I think it is good you’re here it sounds like that cough that you just had doesn’t sound so good, so thanks for listening to your girlfriend and getting this appointment set up, we can definitely talk about your cold and then we can touch on some other kind of more general health things for a checkup sort of exam and then we can go from there and make some next steps okay?"
"7","  All right, it is okay if we start with the cold or COVID type symptoms?"
"8","  Okay. All right, how long have those been going on?"
"9","  Just feeling crummy, you tell me a little bit more about the symptoms you are having?"
"10","  Oh gosh."
"11","  Okay, well it doesn’t sound like it has been a fun week with all that."
"12","  Sorry to hear that but have you, did you take your temperature at all when you were feeling kind of warm?"
"13","  Okay, all right so nothing, it hasn’t been to a level that felt like a high fever, then just kind of manageable but flushed warm, not feeling super great overall it sound like.  Okay, okay. Have you taken any medications for these symptoms?"
"14","  Yeah, okay.  How has your sleep been?"
"15","  Okay, yeah, that feeling of not really being able to get enough sleep for that level of tiredness perhaps?"
"16","  Yeah, okay, have you had symptoms like this before, have you felt like this in the past?"
"17","  Yeah, well we do appreciate your doing that is you, know it is helpful, to help, make sure you don’t have COVID.  We'll definitely do a COVID test, get that ordered I think that's the right thing to do just with the times we're living in.  Has anybody around you had COVID that you know of?"
"18","  Okay. And did you get the COVID vaccine?"
"19","  Okay.  Are there any questions I can answer about it?"
"20","  Okay, yeah, I know lot of people have various thoughts about it, you know our kind of medical recommendation is that we recommended just to protect from serious COVID infection where you could land up in the hospital and we definitely recommend you after you feel better to get that vaccine if you think about it little more and we can continue that conversation and you can always send a MyChart message if you have more question about it, okay?"
"21","  Okay.  All right and then what about kind of like the general health stuff, your girlfriend is saying you haven't been to the doctor and she is worried about you it sounds like."
"22","  Okay, how do you feel day-to-day outside of this illness, do you general have fatigue or…?"
"23","  That's awesome."
"24","  I was just kind asking what your general kind of life and health looks like, that was helpful information so thank you for sharing about that.  It sounds like you are pretty active with the construction and getting out on the bike I love hearing when people prioritize exercise, it is good for your heart and your brain and whole body so keep that up.  Do you, let's see other things, do you have any medical issues right now that you take medication for like hypertension or diabetes?"
"25","  No, okay."
"26","  Yeah, I saw that just the DayQuil you kind of just take, it looks like, from looking at your chart, all right.  And then do you know if your family, if there is any hypertension or diabetes or heart issue?"
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Okay.  Did you know what she passed away with?"
"29","  Okay.  Thanks for sharing that, you know, think about what risk factors family and genetics can give each individual, we definitely recommend if you haven't gotten a colonoscopy to get that set up that helps evaluate our risk of colon cancer and we can put that, you know, I would rather, you have a primary care physician manage that, so, this is more urgent care but we can put that referral in so you can get that started. What do you think about also getting primary care physician referral in?"
"30","  It does get confusing.  I think just with this being the COVID appointment, we are focusing on that, but you know I am happy to be your primary care provider moving forward so. Are you okay with that, would you like me to be your provider?"
"31","  Yeah, our goal is to keep you out of doctor too so, it won't be too many visits, just recommending, usually I like to see once a year to make sure everything is working okay, especially for your age."
"32","  So yeah, we can, we'll get some of this stuff ordered that we like to check once a year for your age group so if that sounds good to you too we'll check your lipids see if there is any risk of any heart issues, and then I'll put in that referral to get them started, can you set up to do a colonoscopy to look at you risk of colon cancer.  Are you open that as well, both of those?"
"33","  Okay, that sounds good, what we'll do, it sounds like you prefer kind of more of a stepwise approach, so to me that it would be best I think and to you if we just do the COVID test first, see how that goes, what the result it, I'll call you with the results and we can make a plan from there based on the results.  If it is negative, I would like you to come in and get a more full physical exam in person so I can listen to your heart and lungs to figure out if there is something else going on if that wasn't the COVID.  Does that sound okay to you?"
"34","  The one you can, yeah, at the drug store actually isn't as accurate as the one we can do here in clinic so or the clinic does, so I'll have you do the drive through COVID test where they come through and they'll put a swab, it usually is up your nose and get a little bit of…"
"35","  Yeah, it is not as bad as it looks, it is just few seconds of discomfort, but then that will more accurately tell us if this COVID or not and so I'll put in the order and you can come by today to the drive through anytime that works for you okay?"
"36","  Okay.  And after, I am going to have you talk to my nurse to just double check that, if you have any questions about that COVID test and then also about our address and things like that okay?"
"37","  Okay.  We'll go from there.  It was great to meet you and I am looking forward to seeing you and talking to you first after that COVID test is done okay?"
"38","  That's it, we're done, you'll just talk to my nurse briefly we'll log off here okay?"
"39","  Thank you Tom.  Take care."
"40","  Bye-bye."
