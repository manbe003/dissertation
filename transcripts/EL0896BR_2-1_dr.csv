"1","  Tom, I think you are still on mute.  I think the button if you can find it, it is usually in the lower left corner of the Zoom screen."
"2","  Yeah, that is cool."
"3","  That is the one I can hear you."
"4","  Hmm, that is okay."
"5","  Yeah, it is hard.  There is always one thing or another, especially with Zoom."
"6","  Yeah, so that ________."
"7","  Hmm hmm.  We got you.  Umm.  So, my name is Libby.  I am a third year medical student that is going to be talking with you today."
"8","  I had a chance to look at your chart for you logged in, and it said that you are here because you have not been feeling very well?."
"9","  Okay."
"10","  Yeah, Okay.  So, we probably would not have time to do a full checkup today because that is usually something we like to dedicate a whole visit to you.  But it can definitely kind of get something started and I definitely want to hear more about how about your cold, how you have been feeling?"
"11","  Okay, so kind of when did this start?"
"12","  Okay, so like five days."
"13","  Okay, so almost a week now."
"14","  Okay, umm."
"15","  Yeah, well, good to get checked out.  So what I am hearing is about a bit of a cough, maybe some fevers and very fatigued and stuffy nose, right?"
"16","  And what have you tried for that?"
"17","  Did they help?"
"18","  Yeah.  Is that because of how you are feeling?"
"19","  Okay, yeah.  That is good stuff.  Okay and then any shortness of breath like having a hard time breathing?"
"20","  Okay.  Any known sick contacts, like if you have been around anybody who has similar symptoms?"
"21","  Yeah, absolutely."
"22","  Okay and then did you, have you happened to have had COVID vaccine yet?"
"23","  Yeah, okay.  Now something that is _______job."
"24","  Yeah.  Do you know if she has had the shots?"
"25","  Okay."
"26","  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah, the most common ones right now are two shot series.  So yeah, I mean, obviously once you kind of get over this call, that is something that we are recommending for everybody because not only can it help keep you from getting sick or seriously sick, it can also help keep you from spreading it to other people if you did get it.  Umm.  I trust it.  I think it is good.  I got it and had, you know, no difficulties.  A lot of my family and friends have gotten it at this point and it is all worked out well for everybody.  I, let us see.  So, just because it is going around right now, I do think that it would be good to test you for COVID to make sure that you do not have it.  Umm, because this does sound like it could just be a cold, but if you did have it, you know we would want to.  It is better to know."
"27","  You cannot test over the computer.  Hmm.  So, yeah, we will send you instructions about where you can go to get that.  There are a lot of sites in the area, so we have a little bit of time left.  My, I would recommend that you make another appointment, so we can do kind of a full review of your history."
"28","  But we will see.  I wanted to ask to get a couple of things running.  Have you said you have not been to a doctor in like 10 years, right?"
"29","  I absolutely understand.  Would you be willing to get some just basic blood tests done?"
"30","  Okay.  That would be really helpful before your next appointment, we could have you just check some really basic blood tests to kind of get a snapshot of how your overall health is doing, and if there is anything in particular we need to be talking about and then schedule another visit, which can even be like later this week, to kind of go over your health overall."
"31","  It should definitely be covered by your insurance.  Yeah."
"32","  But I can direct you to the proper people in our office to make sure."
"33","  All right.  So if it is okay with you, I am going to signal Katherine that we are done.  Do you have any questions before we go?"
"34","  Yeah, I think.  Okay, that sounds good.  We will definitely follow up in a couple of days about that COVID test and then about the other test."
"35","  Right."
"36","  Thank you."
