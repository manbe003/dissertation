"1","  Hello."
"2","  Nice to meet you.  My name is Leah."
"3","  And how do you like to be addressed?"
"4","  All right Tom.  Well, I got your chart, but can you tell me what brings you in today or virtually in today?"
"5","  Okay.  Tell me more about that?"
"6","  What symptoms are you having?"
"7","  And then that concern, are you worried that it may be COVID or about something else?"
"8","  How long has the cough been there?"
"9","  Okay.  And can you describe that for me?"
"10","  Anything seemed to make it better or worse?"
"11","  Not really, okay.  So you mentioned the cough, any other symptoms that you have noticed this past week?"
"12","  Okay.  Did you take your temperature by chance?"
"13","  Okay.  And then I think I saw, have you been feeling more tired than usual?"
"14","  Okay.  And this has all been present for about a week?"
"15","  Any runny nose?"
"16","  Okay.  What about, you mentioned scratchiness like a sore throat, is that there?"
"17","  Okay, okay.  Do you feel like there is any; that really fine like postnasal drip dripping down into your throat at all?"
"18","  You think so, okay.  And what medicines have you tried for your symptoms so far?"
"19","  Okay.  And then any trouble breathing?"
"20","  No.  So does it hurt when you take a big deep breath in, not feeling short of breath or anything like that?"
"21","  Okay.  Are you able to stay active, walking around, is that going okay for you?"
"22","  Okay.  Does anyone around you have similar symptoms?"
"23","   And tell me a little bit about kind of your situation, is there any way that you could have gotten exposed to COVID?"
"24","  Okay.  I think it is a very reasonable concern.  I think if that is like a big yes or no, could it be COVID, getting a COVID test is very reasonable.  Is that something that you would be open to?"
"25","  Okay."
"26","  Say that again?"
"27","  They are free."
"28","  It is a nasal swab, so they are not the most comfortable, but those are the most accurate.  So you just have to go to one of the stations and you can either walk up or make an appointment and they will do a nasal swab and then let you know if it is positive for COVID or negative for COVID in like 24 to 48 hours."
"29","  Okay.  Kind of whether or not that is COVID is the answer of whether it is not, whether or not it is COVID is that the most important thing to you or also how do we make you feel better?"
"30","  Both? Okay.  And any other symptoms that I am missing like, vomiting, diarrhea loss of _____?"
"31","  Okay.  Then, I think the most important things will be to treat your symptoms and so unfortunately there is not really like a great catch all thing, but if you are open to over-the-counter medicines, you can take like a decongestant that is over-the-counter if you are feeling stuffy and that can also help dry up some of that kind of a drainage that you are feeling that might be contributing to the cough.  So that would be something like Sudafed or Mucinex, anything like that.  Do you think that sounds reasonable?"
"32","  Okay.  And then for the fever and the tiredness, well one if you can get a thermometer it would be great if we could track your temperature, because if it is not high, I do not want to tell you to take something like Tylenol, because you do not need it.  Right?  But if you are feeling achy, even if you do not have a fever, one tablet over-the-counter of Tylenol is okay.  And then for the tiredness, the best thing you can do is just to keep hydrated, pump those fluids, trying to get as much sleep as you can, all that you know stuff that our moms told us long ago.  How does that sound?"
"33","  Anything else?"
"34","  Okay.  Have you had a physical?"
"35","  No?  When was the last time?"
"36","  That is a decent amount of time ago."
"37","  Yes.  Well, that is good.  I am very glad that you are feeling pretty good.  I thinkâ€¦"
"38","  Yes, not today.  For a checkup, since it has been about 10 years possibly, I think the best thing is to do an in-person visit.  Is that something you are comfortable with?"
"39","  And then when you are feeling a little bit better, is that reasonable?"
"40","  Because then you can meet in person, they can do all the, you know, listen to your heart and lungs, I think that physical exam is really important for that, and then also probably they will want to get some basic labs when you go in to kind of get a new baseline to see how your overall health is doing."
"41","  So, that would probably be another visit."
"42","  Okay.  Was there anything in particular also you are worried about today that I can address?"
"43","  Okay.  Then I think the main next steps will be, one, getting that COVID test.  So you can, actually I think the best way is just going through the county, which is free, so you can Google King County COVID tests and find a site, either walk up or make an appointment that works for your timeframe.  And then the next thing will be to call our office and schedule an in-person physical appointment and that could be with me or with anyone else."
"44","  Any other questions?"
"45","  Okay.  All right. And then what about the, about the over-the-counter medicines that we discussed?"
"46","  Sudafed and Mucinex for the nose and the postnasal drip and then if you are feeling achy or feverish, you could take a Tylenol."
"47","  And then lots of water, lots of sleep."
"48","  Okay.  And that is kind of regardless of what COVID shows.  I will keep an eye out for the test results, but whether it is positive or negative, the main thing is getting you feeling better.  And then just some anticipatory guidance, some of those questions I was asking you about, you know the shortness of breath or if you are having a hard time walking around, that if you do start having those symptoms, then I start getting more concerned and I want you to go to the ER."
"49","  Okay.  All right, anything else I can help answer for you?"
"50","  Okay.  Well, I hope you feel better soon.  I am sorry you are feeling crummy."
"51","  And then we will see you in our office soon."
"52","  All right, take care."
