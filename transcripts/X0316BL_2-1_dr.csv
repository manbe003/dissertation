"1","  Hello.  Oh Freddie, I think you're, I think you’re muted right now.  I can't hear you.  Can you, are you -- there should be a little button at the bottom left to your screen that says mute and I think you're going to or unmute excuse me, I think if you hit that real quick, we might be able to, might be able to hear you."
"2","  Yeah, I can hear you."
"3","  Oh, gosh.  Zoom is not my friend either, I don't like it."
"4","  Gotcha.  Well, it's nice to meet you.  My name is Benjamin.  Is it alright if I call you Freddie? "
"5","  Oh perfect.  Well, I was just looking through your chart and I was seeing that we're just here for kind of a routine visit, is that right?"
"6","  Uh huh.  And just to make sure, any concerns or anything you wanted to cover today for sure?"
"7","  Oh, gotcha.  Is that -- tell me about that, how has that been?"
"8","  Gotcha, gotcha.  So if I could summarize it, and it primarily it's after you know long days or after days at work it feels like, it feels like you don't have the energy that you used to that you can go hang out with your grandchildren and play with them."
"9","  Okay, okay.  How long has that been going on for?"
"10","  About six months.  Was there a point at which you kind of noticed a change or was it just kind of gradual over six months?"
"11","  Gotcha, gotcha.  Any other symptoms you've noticed along with this, any chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that, that is kind of you feel like it's limiting your ability to complete your routine daily activities or is it truly just fatigue, that's it?"
"12","  Okay, okay.  Any lightheadedness or dizziness?"
"13","  No.  Any changes in your diet that have kind of taking place over the last year or leading up to the six months?"
"14","  Pretty steady.  Okay, okay.  So we can talk about that a little bit later, get back into that or about the fatigue, but just so I hit all the, all the things that we should talk about, your diabetes, how has that been going?"
"15","  Into the yellow?"
"16","  Do you know what number value that is by chance?"
"17","  250.  And what has kind of been your range in the past?"
"18","  130 to 200.  And I see you're taking the metformin and it says that you take that twice per day."
"19","  And the glipizide and you take that with meals twice per day."
"20","  Yeah.  Any other medications you're taking besides those two?"
"21","  No.  Okay.  And so it sounds like you were previously on the you know monitored a good control and now it's been drifting up into the yellow range.  Is that right?"
"22","  Yeah, it's very possible.  That's why I wanted to talk about it.  Do you know, I guess why do you think that your blood sugar has been going up?"
"23","  Okay."
"24","  Okay.  Okay, I see you've been walking more but."
"25","  Anything that you've been doing that you might relate to higher blood sugar, have you been eating different foods, have you been taking less of your medications, taking them at a different time?  What do you -- why do you think the values have been higher?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","  Okay.  So you have a pretty good system that sounds like to make sure you you’re your medicines, never had problems getting your medicines, but sometimes I know these can get expensive."
"28","  Okay.  And just to kind of round it out a little bit to make sure I'm not missing anything, you said your diet hasn’t changed, can you kind of take me through what a day's worth of food looks like, like what sort of things you eat?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Okay."
"31","  Gotcha."
"32","  Fried chicken on the weekends, gosh.  Okay.  And you, and in terms of your day-to-day meals, is that pretty typical or is there some variety, like some days you bring lunch or do you almost always go out to eat for lunch ______?"
"33","  Gotcha, gotcha, yes."
"34","  Gotcha, okay, okay.  And any other medical conditions as I'm reading on your chart here, you've dealt with high blood pressure in the past?"
"35","  And cholesterol too, okay.  Do you check your blood pressure at home at all?"
"36","  Okay, what do you normally get?"
"37","  Okay, okay.  Well that's, I mean that's pretty good, that's where it's, you know, that's right about where we want you.  So that's really good to hear, good job.  And yet, you mentioned you've been walking a little bit more, trying to exercise.  What other exercise do you do? "
"38","  Okay.  And how does it feel with that exercise, do you feel, does it feel good, do you feel limited in when you exercise in any way, how does that go?"
"39","  Okay, okay, good.  No chest pain with activity?"
"40","  Gotcha, okay, okay.  And no shortness of breath, you don't feel like you've been limited in your ability to exercise because of shortness of breath at all?"
"41","  Okay, and the fatigue that you feel, it's not as if one day you are able to walk a few miles and then past six months now you can only walk 100 feet?"
"42","  Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha."
"43","  And any other surgeries that you're -- or any surgeries you've had in the past?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  I'm sorry, say that again?"
"46","  Oh.  Nothing recently though, okay.  Any family history of diabetes or cancer?"
"47","  Diabetes too, okay, okay.  She is still alive?"
"48","  Sounds good.  Any heart disease in the family?"
"49","  Okay."
"50","  Oh, gotcha, gotcha."
"51","  Yeah.  And any cancers that you know of in your family?"
"52","  Okay, okay.  And then you mentioned you work at a retirement home.  Any or how long have you been there?"
"53","  About 10 years.  Oh, sounds like you're the guy to go to, to fix any problems, huh?"
"54","  Yeah, yeah."
"55","  Oh, gosh, I hear you, it’s funny.  Any, just kind of ______ going to talk a little bit about some other things that can inputs your health.  Any tobacco use?"
"56","  No.  Any alcohol use?"
"57","  Special occasions only, okay.  And any other illicit drug use, meth, heroin, cocaine, or anything like that?"
"58","  Okay, okay.  Well, so that's pretty much all my questions.  I'm just going to go down a list of symptoms from head to toe and then just to make sure I'm being complete and you just tell me if you've been feeling any of these symptoms, okay?"
"59","  Any recent changes in vision or speech?"
"60","  No.  Any problems with balance or dizziness?"
"61","  No.  You already mentioned you haven’t had any chest pain and no shortness of breath, but have you felt your heart racing at all?"
"62","  No, okay.  Any problems with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?"
"63","  No.  Any problems with urination, having to go too frequently, blood in your urine or not feeling like you're able to go when you try to?"
"64","  Okay, okay.  How long has that been going on for?"
"65","  Okay, okay.  And then any numbness or tingling in your feet?"
"66","  No.  Do you feel any weakness in your legs or any problems moving your hands or numbness or tingling in your hands?"
"67","  No, okay, okay.  Those are all my questions.  I do have a few recommendations for you if that's alright, specifically in relation to your diabetes and the fatigue you've been feeling."
"68","  You know, I think, I think your, you know, I think it's worthwhile to recheck some of your lab values, you know, it's been years since you've been here to see the doctor.  I'm looking at your lab values from a year ago and it looks like your A1c, the measurement that we used to track your diabetes was a little bit elevated.  It was 7.9% and we want you someplace a little bit lower than that, kind of in the 7 you know the 7 range or closer to 7.  So, I think that's a really good first step is reduce some of these lab values for you.  I'd really like to check the A1c.  I'd really like to check your kidneys to see how your kidneys are doing.  I think those are some of the big ones.  Now, one thing I see that you're not on since you have diabetes, people especially with high blood pressure can take a medicine called lisinopril and lisinopril can protect the kidneys.  Have you ever taken that medication before?"
"69","  No.  What's your feelings on that, taking the medication to protect your kidneys, it would help your blood pressure, but then it's been shown to do a really good job protecting your kidneys if you have diabetes."
"70","  You know, for some people very small percentage it can cause swelling in the lips and if it gets, if you get swelling in your lips or have problems breathing, I want you to go to the emergency room right away."
"71","  That's the worst one and it happens very rarely, but it happens enough that I need to tell you about it.  Now the things that you'll probably or that you might experience is more of a cough, a dry cough."
"72","  ______ know that would annoy some people and then besides that, the side effect is longevity of life which is a good side effect."
"73","  Yeah.  So that would be, you know, that would be one recommendation I would have that I wanted to talk to you about is starting a baby dose of lisinopril. "
"74","  Yeah, just a little bit.  It will protect your kidneys.  I see that, you know, we haven’t checked the creatinine, so the creatinine is what we used to track how your kidneys are doing.  We can also check a little dipstick to see if any proteins in your urine which is another test, so I'd like to order that as well.  And besides those changes or I guess before we move on, what do you think about the medication and checking those labs, do you feel like that's a good idea?"
"75","  Okay, okay good.  And then the last thing is really just talking about your diet because I feel like the diet is, I feel like that could be the cause of you, you know, having these blood sugar elevations.  I think that's probably why."
"76","  Yeah, I mean that's a great question.  I wish I had a good answer for you, but I would say that when you eat food that you don't cook yourself, there's less control over it.  Right?  You don't have control over how much, you know, what sort of carbs are in the fries, what sort of carbs are in the Coca-Cola.  And it's, you know, it's often hard to kind of keep track of all those things, and so I think it would be a great idea for you and I'm sure it's like your opinion is, if we were to kind of slowly phase out eating out like that, so you know, let's say next week instead of eating out every day for lunch, you start to phase out where, you know, you take a day off from eating out and you keep doing that each week until you're no longer eating out at lunch.  You can still bring food from home that you are cooking, but then you know what the food is, then you know, then you can go out, you can go to a park, go whatever you want, but then you're not actually going and eating the fast food, which I think is kind of having some of these fats. "
"77","  Yeah, yeah."
"78","  That will be a little bit hard for you."
"79","  Are there any options besides McDonald's or you know some you know salads or anything else that you like to eat that might be a little bit, that might not have as much of an effect on your blood sugar?"
"80","  Yeah."
"81","  Yeah."
"82","  Yeah."
"83","  Yeah.  Is it possible for you to bring food from dinner the previous night and eat that for lunch, is that something you don't want to do?"
"84","  Yeah."
"85","  Yeah, yeah.  I would definitely talk with her because, you know, going out and eating a Big Mac, having a Coca-Cola you know lot of bodies change over time.  So even if you've been eating the same thing for eight years, you know, maybe you could tolerate it at first, but now your body is getting to the point where it just really doesn’t like that.  So I would…"
"86","  You know start to think about other things you could eat.  You know, you don't need to go through drastic changes, but if you can just start, you know, bringing food from home, you know, things that you know is good, home cooked food, healthy food, I bet you're going to notice some changes in your blood sugar for the better."
"87","  Okay, perfect.  Well, you know, that's really, those are really the big things.  It sounds like you have a great plan at home for how you're taking medications.  You're not missing any doses.  You know, we talked a little bit about the diet and then we talked about starting you on this low dose lisinopril medication to protect your kidneys and checking your labs.  Does all that make sense?  Is there any questions that you have that I can answer for you?"
"88","  I think it really will because, you know, having this kind of periodic blood sugar elevations, it can really make you feel fatigued especially later in the day."
"89","  So, I would definitely be mindful that you know although you like to have the Big Mac and you like to you know get the Coca-Cola and go out, I would say, you know, it's a good thing to start shifting away from especially if you want to have some energy to go help or to go hang out with your grandchildren."
"90","  Yeah."
"91","  Yeah, yeah.  Like I said, I'm just trying to plant a little seed then you'll plant a seed and see what you think, so I'm happy that you're considering it, that's really good."
"92","  Perfect, well.  Any other questions?"
"93","  Perfect, okay, okay.  And you have enough, how do you check your blood sugar?  I forgot to ask you."
"94","  Say that again, you do it twice a week."
"95","  Okay, okay.  Do you have enough test strips to check daily, is that something you could do?"
"96","  You are not a stuff.  Okay.  And you know, I'm curious if our clinic would be able to provide you with some test strips.  If we're able to get you test strips, would you feel comfortable checking daily? "
"97","  Yeah, but that will give us a much better idea about what sort of, you know, what sort of blood sugars you have on a daily basis."
"98","  Yeah, so I'm going to -- I'll talk with our clinic manager and see if we could get you some sent over."
"99","  Perfect.  Alright, well, hey it was great to meet you and thanks for taking the time out of your day to talk with me."
"100","  Alright.  I'll talk to you later."
