"1","  Hi.  Are you Freddie?"
"2","  Hi, my name is Tiniya, I am one of the student doctors here in the clinic."
"3","  Yeah, I read a little bit about you, but tell me what brings you here today?"
"4","  Okay, well.  First off, I’m sorry that you had some poor interactions with your prior provider.  Tell me a little bit more about, it’s my first time meeting you."
"5","  Tell me a little bit more about what you understand about your diabetes like what it is, what you’ve been told?"
"6","  Yeah.  So, first off, I would love to chat with you more about your diabetes but I think that we should focus if it’s okay with you this visit on kind of the tiredness and make sure that we’re checking off all the red boxes and not just attributing it to your diabetes."
"7","  You are right that diabetes can sometimes cause people to feel a little bit more low energy, but there are also a lot of other things that can make people feel low energy."
"8","  So, other than low energy, have you noticed any other associated symptoms?"
"9","  Okay.  When you say you pee a lot, can you give me like an idea of how frequently, how much about that you are peeing every day?"
"10","  Okay and how long have you been doing that for, the peeing a lot?"
"11","  Yeah, and when you were diagnosed with your diabetes?"
"12","  Okay.  Has the frequency of your urination changed in the last six months along with this tiredness that you’re experiencing?"
"13","  Okay.  Are you also more thirsty?"
"14","  Okay and when you are saying your medications for diabetes, I understand that you have two medications for your diabetes, one of them is, they’re both pills."
"15","  Both of them are two a day medications, you take it in the morning and at evening."
"16","  Okay and are you taking more pills?"
"17","  Okay and you’ve been taking your medications pretty consistently?"
"18","  Okay and then are you having any shortness of breath or chest pain?"
"19","  Okay.  Do you feel like your exercise tolerance has gone down?"
"20","  That sounds like a lovely thing to do."
"21","  Okay and so you are still working then I take it since you mentioned work."
"22","  How are you sleeping?"
"23","  Okay and is that interruptive sleep or is that pretty good, you wake up in the morning feeling refreshed?"
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Okay, are you noticing that you are having more swelling in your legs?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","  Okay.  Do you check your weight on occasion?"
"28","  Do you feel like you are losing or gaining weight, pants are getting tighter or loser?"
"29","  Okay, okay.  I am asking a lot of these questions because sometimes when you have a diagnosis of diabetes for about eight years now, diabetes is a sugar disease as you so astutely mentioned and sometimes the increased sugar levels can cause blocked vessels and that can lead to an increase risk of having heart disease or heart problems and so that’s why I was asking you all these questions about leg swelling and shortness of breath and chest pain because when you have diabetes for a long period of time, it can lead to some of these issues and these issues with heart problems can lead to people feeling tired.  I’m not saying that’s what you have, but I am just trying to figure out making sure that we’re covering all our bases and treating you appropriately to prevent anything bad from happening."
"30","  In terms of your tiredness, we do live in the Pacific Northwest.  Are you taking vitamin D supplement by chance?"
"31","  Okay.  Do you get out in the sun a lot?"
"32","  Okay.  Do you happen to know or check your blood sugars?"
"33","  Twice a week."
"34","  Is it after or before breakfast?"
"35","  Okay and what have your values been looking like?"
"36","  Okay and are they more towards the 200 end or more towards the 130 end?"
"37","  Okay.  I did see that you have a recent blood work done that checks what we called a hemoglobin A1c, which is our fancy term for just a measurement of your blood sugars over a three-month period and it was a little elevated and I am not surprised given that you are reporting blood sugar is in the 200s.  I think for your tiredness, it sounds like it’s not related to your heart because you are not reporting any symptoms, but I think that one of the best things to do just to make sure we’re not missing something is to have you seen in person in clinic so that we can do a physical exam."
"38","  Is that something that you would be willing to do and schedule?"
"39","  Gotcha!"
"40","  Yeah."
"41","  Okay.  Our medical assistants are very lovely and they will help.  They can get on the phone with you and help you figure out when would best work for you to get set up for that."
"42","  In the interim, your diabetes is not very well controlled.  Usually, we like to see our blood sugars in the morning a little below 130 and nothing in the 200s, which sounds like sometimes you are.  There is one of your medications the metformin that you are taking is actually on the lower dose of what we can prescribe or what we usually prescribe for diabetes.  Would you be interested in maybe going up on the dosage of that and trying that for a little while?"
"43","  Yeah.  So, there is two forms of metformin, the one of them is the extended-release form and the extended-release form has lower risk of GI side effects, meaning like you might have a little bit of diarrhea, you might have a little bit of upset stomach.  So, an option is that we could because right now you are not on the, you are on the short release form and we can switch you to the extended-release form and just increase your dose just a little bit and we can gradually titrate up as long as you are not having side effects from the medication."
"44","  Does that makes sense?"
"45","  Yeah.  The most common side effects to metformin are like GI upset, meaning like upset stomach for a little while and diarrhea, it usually occurs when you first start increasing or first start taking it/increase the dose, but then over time, it sometimes steadies, it kind of goes away when you are taking it for a longer period of time."
"46","  Yeah, yeah."
"47","  I am mentioning the metformin as the first routes mainly because metformin has a lot of data to support usage in diabetes and you are not at the maximum dose.  But glipizide you are actually at near the maximum dose for that."
"48","  And there are a couple of other medications that we could try, but they have a lot more side effects and are proven to be as effective as the two that you are on right now."
"49","  Yeah.  Given that you work at the retirement home, I am sure you know all the long list of cocktails that people are on when they get to a certain age."
"50","  My goal for you is that it seems like other than your diabetes right now, you don’t have that many complications related to diabetes that we know of, but when you do have your next physical exam when you are here, I would like to get some lab work and some urine studies as well to make sure that you don’t have any complications from your diabetes that we can catch right now and treat so that in the long run, you don’t have any complications that will require you to be on these multidrug regimens."
"51","  Is that something that you would be interested in doing?"
"52","  Yeah."
"53","  I think these will, these things will be the first steps to kind of making sure that we can keep you off insulin for a longer period of time."
"54","  Okay.  Just a couple of more questions, are you having any confusion or like episodes of like syncope like fainting or anything like that?"
"55","  Okay.  So, I think the next steps from here would be to get you on the schedule to do a physical exam and get some labs and urine studies done at that time.  I think sooner rather than later would be better just so that we can get the ball rolling or something."
"56","  And then I’ll send a prescription to have you increase the metformin.  So, you are taking two pills a day?"
"57","  Let’s go to three pills a day.  You can either take the third pill at night or in the morning whichever one you prefer."
"58","  Yeah.  Just three total pills of metformin a day, you can divide however you want and we’ll see what your blood sugars look like and if we need to go up another to total four pills."
"59","  Okay.  How do you like that plan?"
"60","  Yeah, the walking is going to be key and I think walking will be really good for you in the long run as well."
"61","  Okay, all right, any other questions or concerns today?"
"62","  Okay.  It was nice meeting you.  I look forward to see you in a very short time to do a complete physical and round up the workup."
"63","  Okay."
"64","  Nice meeting you."
