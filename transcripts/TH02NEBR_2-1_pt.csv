"1","  Is that it?"
"2","  No problem."
"3","  Pleasure meeting you as well."
"4","  Well, I have been feeling a little tired, more so than lately, and I have not been in, in about a year, and so I would take a look and check me out to see if there is anything serious going on."
"5","  Oh, more so tired, lethargic, you know, not a lot of energy as a result of and I think you read on my chart that I have been diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago.  Hmm."
"6","  Uh, no, no other, no other problems in that regards is primarily…"
"7","  Well.  I have been taking 500 mg of metformin and about 10 mg of glipizide, and that is what I have been doing to kind of manage it.  Hmm."
"8","  Ha, yes I have.  This morning when I checked, it was around 215."
"9","  Well, they are pretty consistent, you know.  I know that I just feel a little different sometimes when it is high, but I am not in a position that I can, you know, do testing, so it is just a question of mine.  Hmm."
"10","  No, no.  I have not experienced anything that drastic, no."
"11","  Okay.  Hmm."
"12","  Ah, yes, on an average.  Hmm."
"13","  No, no."
"14","  I am trying to stay away from as much medication as I can, but I still want to manage my diabetes.  Hmm."
"15","  Well, I you know, I think two years ago it was like 6.9 and then it went up to like 7.2 and now the last time I checked it was 7.4, so I am not really concerned about that, but that is where it was."
"16","  Ah, yes, I would consider that, yeah."
"17","  Oh, sure, sure."
"18","  No, no."
"19","  No.  Hmm, hmm."
"20","  Well, no.  The first time I was diagnosed I had tingling in my legs, but you know nothing since then, it is just that, you know, after a hard day's work, I have three grandkids that want to play and run around and I just do not have the energy, you know."
"21","  Right so, yes, yes."
"22","  No, I am actually so busy, I do not pay much attention to diet.  My wife cooks all the meals and so at lunchtime, you know, but no, I have not changed my diet at all."
"23","  Yes, I enjoy her cooking, hmm."
"24","  I walk with my wife once or twice a week, you know, we try to get out and walk, and then you know, and if we are on `vacation, I may, you know, may try to get in a little more exercise than that, but that is generally about it, hmm."
"25","  No, not that I recall.  I have not been around anyone with any type of illness or whatever, so nothing that would, you know, bring be my concern right now."
"26","  No, no."
"27","  Well, no (laughs)"
"28","  Well, yes, it is probably something that I would consider, but as of right now, I have not taken the vaccine, no."
"29","  Okay, hmm, hmm."
"30","  Oh, sure."
"31","  Well that could be a real challenge, but it was something that I would consider if we could work out a plan, hmm."
"32","  That is exactly, exactly, hmm."
"33","  That sounds reasonable, yeah, yeah."
"34","  Oh, okay."
"35","  Well, no, not really, I am just really concerned.  I know I am getting older and I am wondering am I dying, is this a part of the process or something like that?  So, any thoughts are in that area in terms of is it just an aging process?"
"36","  Organs fatigue (laughs)"
"37","  Hmm, hmm."
"38","  Well that is good (laughs)"
"39","  Oh, I just recognize or just remember that I do have, it seems like more frequent urination now than I have in the past and I do not know if that is, you know, related to aging or diabetes or what? You know so…"
"40","  Yes."
"41","  No, nothing like that, it is just like, it seems like I go every 15 minutes, but I do not go every 15 minutes.  It just appears that way.  I can be in the middle of something and realize I have to go and so I just noticed that there has been a slight increase in my urination, and so this bothers me.  It is kind of irritating more so than anything."
"42","  Uh, probably in the last couple of months."
"43","  That's right."
"44","  Hmm.  Okay, hmm."
"45","  Okay, okay, alright.  Well, I just thought I would mention that, again that was something I just noticed that is occurring more frequently as ________ or whatever you know, hmm."
"46","  That sounds okay, yes, hmm."
"47","  Okay, alright, well, that sounds like a plan you know."
"48","  Okay (laughs)"
"49","  I do not know how, but I.."
"50","  It is really hard."
"51","  Really, you know, my lifestyle and all the things that is going on, but…"
"52","  I would like to, you know, maybe try to control whatever is going on with some medication, okay."
"53","  Hmm."
"54","  Okay."
"55","  No, that seems to be a plausible plan that, you know, that I think that would help me get to the point in trying to understand where I am.  I again, it is just been a moment of concern and I just want to be able to keep up with the grandkids, you know?"
"56","  Okay, alright, that sounds great, okay."
"57","  Okay, the same here and Julie, okay."
"58","  Alright. Thank you so much, okay."
"59","  Bye, bye."
"60","  Where do we do this?  Where do we exit?  Oh, okay, yeah, there is a close button, modern technology (laughs)."
"61","  (laughs) I have had power failure down here just about time that I logged on, so..."
"62","  (laughs) It never stops, okay, take good care, alright, bye."
