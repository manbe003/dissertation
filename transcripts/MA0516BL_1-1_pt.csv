"1","  Okay."
"2","  Okay, no problem.  Okay.  My situation is that I was supposed to be Freddy today and you say I am Tom.  So."
"3","  I am just wondering how this is going to work out, okay."
"4","  Okay, alright.  Actually I am here today because I have a little cough and my girlfriend has been bugging me and pushing me to come in and see you because she is concerned that it could be COVID.  So, she wants me to visit for that and she is a schoolteacher and so she works around kids and so that’s the major concern."
"5","  At this time, I don’t, I am not aware of being exposed to it either through my girlfriend or around people that I work with."
"6","  Okay, can you hold for a second, I need to silence my phone, okay."
"7","  Okay, I am back, mm-hmm."
"8","  No other symptoms other than that.  The cough has been going on for little over a week or so, so again it is just a concern.  I haven’t, you know, been in for a while and so, I just want to make sure that everything is okay."
"9","  No, no."
"10","  No, I haven’t had a cold in quite some time, so, you know the coughing is, it’s ongoing, relative to me doing my daily work, you know."
"11","  No, not really.  Whenever I cough, I take some DayQuil and it suppresses the cough and so, that is generally about it."
"12","  No, that could be an over-the-counter NyQuil is all I take."
"13","  It’s been helping.  It’s been helping but it is still there and that is the problem."
"14","  No."
"15","  No, not related to cough or anything.  My grandpa, he had colon cancer.  He got past that and died.  I am not sure how old he was and my mother had breast cancer and so she survived that and she passed two years ago from natural causes and so, yeah that’s just about it in terms of the family history."
"16","  No."
"17","  No.  I have a couple of beers but that just about it."
"18","  Well, I work in construction.  Okay, so I am moving about pretty much __long__ and I do some walking with my wife or biking with my wife, you know, once or twice a week, and when I am on vacation we will take maybe about a two mile bike hike."
"19","  That’s been okay."
"20","  No."
"21","  No."
"22","  That sounds like a plan.  I have just read up a lot on COVID and I am just been on defensive about it, so, I thank you for recommendation, I would never say yes, at least get tested."
"23","  Okay, okay but again primarily my concern is that it is just a cold you know."
"24","  And as I am getting older, I am just kind of trying to….. your screen is frozen."
"25","  Okay, again, I just, you know, just want to make sure that nothing else more serious is going on other than a cold."
"26","  Okay, okay, alright."
"27","  Well, no, I think that the only other thing that happens with me, its not a real concern because it’s been going on for some time and that’s frequent diarrhea and that's been going on for, you know, the past three years and so, its just one of those things but no, I don’t have any loss of control of my bladder or anything."
"28","  No, it’s been about the same, but I haven’t been on a scales lately, you know, I can't really say specifically that I have lost weight, but I don’t feel like I have lost weight.  So, I know, I could bring a mirror, so."
"29","  I haven’t had a colonoscopy."
"30","  Let me think about that one, okay.  If you, I would say, if you highly recommend it then I heard that they are not a very pleasant experience though."
"31","  No, that’s really been about it and again, I am just really concerned about the cold and hopefully it’s not more than that, anything more serious than that but from what your recommendations have been, you know, after being tested and went over, I think we can narrow down to what could be the possible problem and what I would do to alleviate some of the discomfort of the cold."
"32","  Okay, okay, that sounds like a plan.  Any other suggestion that you have for me?"
"33","  Okay, alright.  Well thank you so much.  I really appreciate it and I look forward to coming in eventually to see you in person and then we can review the test results on the __server__ and then take it from there."
"34","  Thank you so much, and is it Jourie."
"35","  Okay.  Thank you so much."
"36","  Alright bye-bye."
