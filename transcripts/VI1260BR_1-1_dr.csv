"1","  Hi there, Mr. Jones."
"2","  Hi, Freddie.  It's nice to meet you.  My name is Maddy.  I am a medical student working at the clinic today.  How are you today?"
"3","  Well, I am hoping to.  It sounds like you are, you are not doing as well as you might be, what is going on?"
"4","  Yeah, I mean, it's, it's really hard to get into clinic these days.  So, but I hear that you are concerned about some of your lab numbers increasing?"
"5","  Are you, are you talking about your, your hemoglobin, your blood sugar counts?"
"6","  Yeah.  So, we can definitely talk about those because it sounds like those are at the top of your mind today.  Just to make sure I cover everything you want to cover, is there anything else you wanted to make sure we talk about today?"
"7","  Okay, it sounds good and I see that some, one of our assistants noted that you were even feeling really tired lately.  Is that something also that was bothering you or not anything?"
"8","  Okay, well, I think those are things we can both talk, we can talk about both of those.  I think, you know, with your, your numbers going up, sometimes people have symptoms when those, when that blood sugar goes up.  Have you been having like, really, really, really thirsty lately where you have to pee a lot more often?"
"9","  Okay.  How long have you been experiencing that?"
"10","  Okay. I see and have you had any new headaches lately?"
"11","  Okay.  Any troubles seeing?"
"12","  Okay, good, good.  Any chest pain or trouble breathing, palpitations and anything like that?"
"13","  Okay, great, great.  So, it sounds like so when we are really, really thirsty and we are peeing a lot, sometimes that is a sign that blood sugar is really high.  And there is kind of different ways that we can go about that.  One way would be to talk about like things like diet and exercise, what we call lifestyle changes and the other way we can tackle it is with adjusting your medications."
"14","  Yeah, which, you know, those are both really good ways to go about it.  Which one do you feel like you want to start with?"
"15","  We can also do both as an option."
"16","  Yeah, okay.  Can you tell me about your medicine right now and what you are taking and how you are taking it?"
"17","  Great and how often are you taking those?"
"18","  You know, it is really hard to take medicine everyday, to remember to do anything everyday.  I know personally, sometimes I forget to take my medicine, maybe like two or three times a week.  Does that sound familiar to you?"
"19","  Yes, yeah, definitely.  So, that can be one culprit of why your, your sugars are going up as well."
"20","  So, let's see what is a way that you, why do you think you are having trouble taking it everyday?"
"21","  I hear yeah, it's busy time, got things to do.  Have you ever tried to like set an alarm for yourself or anything like that as a reminder?"
"22","  Okay, that might, that helps some people remember to take their medications, you can like program it into your phone if that is helpful or set an alarm in your radio.  That sometimes helps."
"23","  The other thing that sometimes people find helpful is to use a pill organizer.  Do you have one of those at home?"
"24","  It's like a little box.  I don't have one to show you, but it's a little box with, a box for everyday of the week."
"25","  Yeah, they're really cool, one time a week, you just fill a pill in every little box and then that is it.  You don't have to worry about the bottle for the rest of the week, you just take your pill, and then that tells you whether you have taken your medicine that day because it's only for that one day."
"26","  Yeah.  Does that sound like something you might want to try or something that might help you?"
"27","  Okay, excellent.  Well, we can definitely organize that, we can have our pharmacists get in touch with you and send one of those to you, and we can go through it together and talk about how to do that."
"28","  I think that might be a great place to start."
"29","  And kind of, we will see kind of see you back in a few months and see how that is going and there is room to go up on the dosage of your medication too."
"30","  If you are still struggling with it, then that is another option."
"31","  How is that sounding to you?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  Umm and then, you know, with the diet and lifestyle changes and stuff, it is kind of similar to what you have probably heard before, with just being really conscious of eating a healthy, balanced diet with not too much sugar, lots of fruits and vegetables and getting healthy amount of exercise each day too."
"33","  Okay and I am wondering, you know, when you mentioned that you were feeling tired, do you think can you tell me more about that and maybe how it's impacting, how you can exercise and be active each day?"
"34","  Hmm, hmm.  It sounds like you've got a lot going on."
"35","  Yeah.  Um, are you having any trouble staying awake during the day?"
"36","  Okay."
"37","  (laughs) okay and how are you sleeping at night?"
"38","  Sleep well, okay.  Any new like aches and pains, fevers, chills, anything like that?"
"39","  Okay and do you have any trouble like sitting down, standing up from a seat or anything like that?"
"40","  Hmm, okay.  Sometimes, that can happen as we get older, just the way that our joints change as we get older.  Is it, is it hurting to move as fast as you used to or is there a different reason do you think?"
"41","  It doesn't hurt.  Just moving slow, like it's harder to kind of move your, your body the way it used to?"
"42","  Okay umm, and what happens when you try to stand back up after you sit down?"
"43","  Okay, umm and you said you are not having any pain with movement?"
"44","  No pain, okay.  Do you ever feel weak like you, like you are losing control of your knees and you just buckle underneath them?"
"45","  Okay and I know this is kind of a silly question.  So bear with me, but are you having any trouble getting to the bathroom in time like you are, you are peeing or having a bowel movement before you can get there?"
"46","   Perfect okay, that is great.  Well, unfortunately, I can't do a physical exam for you today because we are over the camera, but one thing we could do is, have you seen a physical therapist to kind of evaluate how you are moving and see if there's something that we can do to help you kind of, you know, see if there's something that I can do for you or if, if they can help you out with it?."
"47","  Okay, all right.  I hear yeah.  It sounds like that is really your main concern today in that the kind of fatigue is less important to you."
"48","  Okay, so why don't we do this?  Why don't we work on, I will have our pharmacist talk to you and talk to you about how to fill out that pill bottle, and maybe work on setting an alarm for yourself, and then see how that goes with taking those medications.  And then, we'll see you back here in a few months, check in, see how things are going, and I can also give you a call next week just to check in."
"49","  Yeah and see how at that point, we can make some decisions from there."
"50","  What questions do you have for me about any of that?"
"51","  Okay.  Well, if anything comes up, feel free to get back in touch, but it was a pleasure seeing you today."
"52","  All right."
