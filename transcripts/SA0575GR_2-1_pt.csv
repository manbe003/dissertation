I have been so damn tired lately and now I know that this is something that can be a complication with diabetes so I am lot worried that there maybe something gone wrong here."
"9","  Well, I work all day.  I am okay in the morning.  I work all day and then when I get home, my wife takes care of our grandchildren, there is three of them.  The little ones are too easy and they just _____.  I want to play with them you know.  I want to spend some time with them, but while I get home I am just so damn tired."

"22","   No."
"23","  Not really."
"24","  No."
