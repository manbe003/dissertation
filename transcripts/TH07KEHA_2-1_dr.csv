"1","  Hey, how’re you doing?"
"2","  Not too bad myself.  My name is Lance.  I’m going to be working with you today and I prefer to use he/him pronouns.  Do you have any pronouns that you would prefer to use?"
"3","  Yeah, they sure are.  Alright sounds good.  We will start you Tom then today.  Yeah, pronouns are just kind of useful to help people who might not feel conforming to the gender or gender nonconforming that can identify, but that’s alright, we don’t have to go too much into that because that’s not why you’re seeing me here today for.  But, what are we seeing you today for?"
"4","  Oh, good.  What’s been keeping you away over the past year?"
"5","  What has been keeping you away from the doctor over the past year?"
"6","  Yeah, that's for sure.  Alright, let's go into that.  So, what have you been experiencing with your diabetes."
"7","  How long has that been going on for?"
"8","  Alright.  And then, with that, has it become worse over recent months?  Has it kind of, did it come on suddenly.  How, I guess, how have you noticed this kind of come upon you.?"
"9","  Mm hmm, and has it gotten worse over the last month or so?"
"10","  Alright.  Well, maybe I think that you can kind of focus on over this next month to kind of like see, is it getting worse, is it staying about the same, is it getting better, and then next time we meet, we can definitely talk about that, and look at that and see if there is like a trend with anything there."
"11","  Yeah, so, maybe just like having a notebook could be good, just kind of like write that down every day, or making a note in your phone.  Is that something that you could do?"
"12","  Good deal.  Absolutely, maybe just like adding that into your kind of routine of tracking this, is it better on some days or is it worse on some days, just so we can kind of keep a focus on that for the next time."
"13","  Yeah and you mentioned that you have been keeping track of your blood glucose levels.  Have they been higher than normal, lower than normal, what is the trend then with those lately?"
"14","  Okay, alrighty.  And so, has it been pretty, has it been higher as of like last week or last month, have you noticed like a trend with that at all?"
"15","  Sounds good.  We can then take a look at that.  Sorry, I had a bug in my throat.  It happens, right.  And so, to want to make sure that we are kind of taking care of this issue of being more tired as of recently, have you noticed anything else with the treatment of your diabetes, any other symptoms or have you noticed something else that you’d want to talk about with that today."
"16","  Okay, yeah, we can definitely look into that.  And so, you are taking the metformin and the glipizide, is that correct?"
"17","  Alright.  And, you are taking both of those as prescribed currently, yes?"
"18","  Alright, in your chart, we had that it was twice a day.  So, have you only been taking that once a day recently."
"19","  Yeah, so we have it down as to, we can check into that and see why it says twice a day, but that could be something that might be causing this.  So, we want to make sure that we are getting that properly taken for you."
"20","  Uh.  Let's go ahead and we will run some tests and everything and see kind of like what your hemoglobin A1c levels are.  We are just going to see if we think that’s going to be necessary or if it’s going to be sufficient to have the one.  So, we are going to get back to you on that, but we will give you an answer for that later on."
"21","  Mm hmm.  Yes, so the last number we had was in March of 2021.  Have you had any more recent hemoglobin A1c's taken."
"22","  Alrighty.  And so, that was a little over a year ago.  Do you think that you would be able to come in and get a blood test taken, so we can make sure of that once again?"
"23","  Yeah.  That can just give us a clear idea of how the diabetes has either progressed, stayed the same, or even maybe improved a little bit with these medications.  They can help us know more about like what medications and the dosages that we need to give you.  So, that will be a really beneficial thing to come in and have that blood test taken.  Just so we can give you better treatment for these medications."
"24","  Yeah, I'm not sure what the hours of lab are.  We can get back to you on that.  There might be some special circumstances with later at night or on the weekends.  What time do you usually start and get off of work?"
"25","  Alright.  Would it be possible if you could come like early during the morning before your work starts?"
"26","  I'm not actually sure where, well this is Telehealth.  I'm not actually in the clinic.  We are just working with you today.  So, I can't quite answer that, but we can find out information and get back to you."
"27","  So, that kind of depends on your work schedule then, but we will make sure that we can try to figure out something, so we can get that taken care of, so we can take care of you.  So, with this kind of more recent not to say like tired spells, but like being more tired recently and the fatigue and everything.  You mentioned that it kind of hinders your ability to like play with your grandchildren and everything, and that is kind of really a large source of joy for you, but have you noticed it impacting your life in any other ways."
"28","  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, and we want to hopefully help you with the uncertainty and kind of give you some answers.  So, hopefully we can get close to you, and so with this, what has your diet been like?  Has it been like vegetables, fruits, grains, and everything.  Can you kind of describe what an average diet would be for you, like on an average day?"
"29","  Yeah.  I understand why.  I also really love ice cream, so I get it where you’re coming from with that.  Would you say that you usually have any fruits or vegetables with any of your meals?"
"30","  Alrighty.  Yeah, and so maybe something that might also help because obviously we are not in the clinic together today, but my help is to kind of keep a track of that diet and maybe to kind of implement more fruits and vegetables and more healthy options like a lunch kind of you mentioned kind of laying off McDonald's, may be taking a lunch to work to kind of help you eat more nutritious foods throughout the day to kind of help see if that helps with these symptoms of being more tired with your diabetes because some of those foods will result in more instant release which can be problematic with people with diabetes, and so it’s going to kind of like take off all those factors and see if there are any natural remedies that we can do as well instead of just like relying completely upon those medications to make sure they are taking care of everything for you.  Does that make sense?"
"31","  Yeah, so what I am hearing you say is like, the food that you are eating is really important to you and you really enjoy that food, but I remember at the beginning of this telehealth meeting, you said that your health is also really important to you, and so I just kind of like want to find the balance between those two, so we can help you be healthy, help you have that energy to kind of play with your grandchildren, as well as just like maintain a healthy lifestyle, but something with glipizide is that it’s kind of taking with diet as well as exercise as kind of like a medication as well, and so even though diet and exercise are medications, they still are able to help your body respond better to other insulin and everything, and so with that, do you exercise frequently or not really."
"32","  Awesome, and I forgot, what do you do for work?"
"33","  Okay, awesome.  That's a lot of really good work you are doing then, so thank you for that.  And so, with that, you mentioned that you like have been doing more rounds around the work as well as like about a weekly walk or so, and then play with the grandchildren, but do you think that, as we know like diet is really important and exercise is really important, do you think that you will be able to implement maybe a little bit more exercise, maybe say two walks a week at first and kind of see if that exercise is able to kind of help with your symptoms."
"34","  Yeah.  So, what do you think are some of the things that are taking your time up, that what kind of inhibit you from exercising a bit more."
"35","  Hmm.  That's understandable, we are just like wanting to encourage more exercise just because it is kind of like a natural remedy for us that we can use to kind of supplement the medications that you are taking for diabetes and you know, even if it is just a 5-minute walk, 5 minutes is much better than not at all, so just do it if you are able to, but if you can add a little bit more in, that would be phenomenal."
"36","  Yeah, and I know that you mentioned with your last provider that you kind of stopped seeing him because he said to stop eating the fried chicken and everything, and I don’t want to just kind of lose you as a patient as well, but I do care about your health, and so with your diet, there are things that we can do to kind of just be healthier, and so you mention like eating the eggs in the morning which is great because it gives you that energy and everything.  At lunchtime, you are kind of having at McDonald's, and dinnertime you have like the steak and potatoes, and you are kind of limited with what you are eating at home, like you mentioned because your wife, Louise is cooking for you.  But, at lunch, do you think that maybe you could try a healthier alternative than McDonald's to kind of see if you can have something else for lunch, every once in a while?"
"37","  Yeah, for sure."
"38","  Yeah, best step when you get the thing to check out if there is anything like a salad or like a wrap, or anything that might be not as greasier, kind of all of those fatty foods that we, sometimes associate with like fast food.  If we can find some healthy alternatives, that would be great.  But also you could consider maybe taking a lunch to work, that would be healthier that way, you don't have to leave at all, and you would have time to kind of sit and enjoy yourself, maybe rest up a little bit, so that you can have some more energy when you get home to your kids.  Would that be something that you would consider?"
"39","  Yeah, for sure, and like, you know a lot of changes go at once like, you’re going to exercise more, trying to kind of change your eating habits a little bit, but just kind of take it one day at a time and implement small changes here and there because as you know like small changes as we kind of build upon them really add up.  Just not the big and we know like diet and exercise as well as the medications that you are on are able to kind of really help with your quality of life with this, with like treating diabetes, because it sounds like you are tired right now, and you want to make sure that you have energy to play with your kids, and so we are definitely going to want to kind of work with you to kind of get you to that place where you want to be, and so I guess, would you be okay with setting a goal today?"
"40","  Yeah, so, right now, you like, you mentioned that you are tired when you get home from work, and like then you want to play with the grandkids, so maybe your goal would be to implement eating out less often at McDonald's for lunch as well as trying to add in 5 minutes of exercise on a walk like adding that in once a week as well, so it’s like two walks a week and then kind of adding that in, that way, you can kind of see if your energy levels kind of increase and that goal basically is to do those things so that you can have more energy to play with your grandchildren.  Because that sounds like it is something like you really enjoy doing, and so we want to make sure that you are able to do that.  Does that make sense?"
"41","  Yeah, so what would that goal be for you then?  I want you to set it for yourself.  I don't want to set it for you because I want you to say what’s manageable for you.  So what do you think would be manageable for you right now?"
"42","  Yeah, so maybe let's just start to have that as our goal for now and then later on, we can add exercise or anything.  And with that, you mentioned switching from McDonald's to Burger King, that might not be the healthiest option either, because Burger King is also kind of really heavily fatty fried foods that we kind of associate with fast food, but if there is anything like eating like a Subway or anything else that kind of has healthier options that you can get."
"43","  Yeah, maybe trying one of those other options out there that doesn’t have those fatty, greasy, heavy meals could be beneficial."
"44","  Yeah, pizza by the slice, tastes good, and isn’t necessarily the best for us.  Do you think that you want to try out like maybe like a salad for lunch every once in a while.  You don’t have to do it every single day, of course because a salad every once in a while can do wonders for us."
"45","  Yeah, and that's what we want you to do, it's like, even if you just try, like trying is enough for us because we want to help you get to that goal of being, of having more energy to play with your grandchildren, and it's improving time and again with other patients that are doing these things is able to help that, and so even though it might not taste as good as McDonald's, I think it would be even better to have the energy to play with your grandkids it sounds like.  So, we want to help you to do those things to kind of get you back to that level of energy for you."
"46","  Yeah, so even it's difficult, think about your grandkids next time you are eating that salad and it will kind of help you get that desire to eat that salad again, I guess."
"47","  Yeah, we'll definitely check in again with you next time.  And, in between then, we will get you information about giving that blood test, we can see where your hemoglobin A1c is because that’s like a marker just for your blood sugar for the past three months.  So, if we can get that blood test in, and then we can kind of monitor your energy levels as you go throughout like the next month until we can meet again, that would be really beneficial, so we can see if any of these changes that we are implementing are working.  I am also let you know about the medication if you should be taking that once a day or twice a day with the glipizide."
"48","  Yeah, do you have any other questions for me today, Freddie?"
"49","  That's kind of hard to tell you exactly how things are going while we are not in the clinic together."
"50","  You know like, can’t listen to your heart, can’t listen to your lungs over Zoom of course, but we do want to make sure that we are able to treat this like the fatigue that you have been having, because it has been coming on recently, but generally it says that something might be going on, and so we want to make sure that we kind of get to the bottom of that, and that will really help with the hemoglobin A1c test will be able to help us have a better idea of what might be going on, and so this is really important that we get that test in and then we can kind of give you a little bit more information as we go along with this."
"51","  Alrighty.  Any other questions today, Freddie?"
"52","  Alrighty.  Well, if that’s the case then, I hope you have a great rest of your evening.  Hopefully, you can get home to your grandkids and have a good time with them tonight.  We know that that’s important to you so."
"53","  Yeah, of course.  You have a great night, and we will see you next time."
"54","  Right, have a great night. Right bye-bye."
