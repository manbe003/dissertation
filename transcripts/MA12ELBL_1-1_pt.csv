"1","  Hello?"
"2","  I am doing great today.  How are you?"
"3","  Yes."
"4","  Well, I know that I should come in more frequently because of my diabetes, and I havenâ€™t been in for about a year, so I just want to come and check in with you to make sure that everything is going okay."
"5","  Preferably my numbers I would hope would be in the low 6 or 7 range.  But it is about 7.9 at the present time when I asked the result of this morning and the real issue is that I'm feeling tired, you know, and I just want to kind of be able to keep up with my grandkids and so that's why I'm here, but did that kind of answer your question?"
"6","  No, not really.  I just think that I'm getting a little bit older, so that could be part of the process and I have noticed that, you know that the numbers are getting a little bit high.  I think if it got to 8 I would really be concerned, a little more so."
"7","  Yes, I do."
"8","  Well, this morning when I checked it was like 215."
"9","  In the couple of months, I noticed that it is moving more towards the yellow zone so and over time."
"10","  Yes."
"11","  Not from the medication.  I don't think, you know."
"12","  I - at the end of the day, I'm just exhausted and I don't know how better to explain that and I have some grandkids, three grandkids, and when I come in, in the evening, and my wife keeps the kids during the - the grandkids during the day and they, you know, have interactions with her and when I come in they want to jump all over grandpa and I just don't seem to have the energy to, you know, actively interact with them."
"13","  No.  I think I average between six and seven hours at night."
"14","  No, I know that I do, but nothing that she has mentioned that is worse than normal."
"15","  No."
"16","  No."
"17","  No."
"18","  No."
"19","  Yes, I - the challenge is that I just don't have a lot of time to do that, but that is, that could be taken into consideration."
"20","  No, it was suggested by the scheduler to have labs done."
"21","  Well, I want to control my diabetes, you know, and would like to have more energy and so whatever you know is possible, I am not really excited about insulin in anyway, but if I can manage it with just meds, I would hope to be able to do that."
"22","  Okay, but you know, my wife, she makes all of the meals and so, it's going to be a little bit of a challenge in that area."
"23","  Yes, yes, I can do that."
"24","  Okay, okay."
"25","  No.  That I - again, as an old man, am I getting older, am I about to die is just one of those questions as I constantly ____ around my head and so and that's why I'm here.  I know that I'm - should come in more, you know, every four to six months, but yes that's where I'm right now."
"26","  Wow!"
"27","  Okay, that's good news."
"28","  No, you pretty much answered you know the concerns that I have, addressed the concerns that I have in regards to you know just feeling tired you know.  I have a business schedule and everything, but still I would like to have a little more energy like I said to interact with my grandkids and things like that."
"29","  That would be okay.  Okay, right, that sounds like a plan."
"30","  Okay, I will make a note of that.  Okay, thank you."
"31","  All right, you too.  Bye-bye."
