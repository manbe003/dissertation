"1","  Good morning, Freddie.  I can't hear you.  I don't know if you're muted."
"2","  Always hard to find."
"3","  (Laughs) I'm Kate.  I'm one the student doctors working with the clinic today.  How are you doing?"
"4","  Good.  I took a moment to just check over your chart and it looks like we're here just to follow up on that __darn__ diabetes."
"5","  (Laughs) Yes.  And it looks like, so are you still taking the metformin?"
"6","  The glipizide."
"7","  Yeah.  How have they been treating you?"
"8"," Okay."
"9","  Yeah.  How old are your grandkids?"
"10","  Ah, fun.  Those are good ages except they have a lot of energy."
"11","  Yes.  Those are the fun ones though."
"12","  No worries.  So, just feeling more tired when you're trying to kind of be active?"
"13","  Okay."
"14","  Okay.  Are you feeling kind of more like your muscles are tired or just your knee."
"15","  Okay, okay.  And this has been like the last six months, is that what I saw?"
"16","  Okay and remind me again, when did we start that metformin?  Was it six months ago or was it before that?"
"17","  Okay.  And have you noticed when you feel more like tired or jittery in the morning or after you take your medications?"
"18","  Okay.  And do you have a way to check your blood sugars at home?"
"19","  Okay, okay.  What have your sugars been when you've been taking them?"
"20","  Okay.  Do you ever get any lower sugars like in the 60s, 70s or 80s?"
"21","  Okay, okay.  And when you feel kind of more tired in the afternoon, you feel jittery. Do you feel lightheaded at all?"
"22","  Okay.  Umm.  And remind me, when is the last time we did any blood work, looks like a little while ago."
"23","  Yeah, that's alright.  We always seem to take your blood.  We're worse than vampires."
"24","  Yeah.  Okay.  And has your diet changed at all lately?"
"25","  Good."
"26","  So, no changes in your diet, haven't really been able to exercise as much as sounds like.  What are you doing for work these days?"
"27"," Oh, okay."
"28","  Yeah, how's work been?"
"29","  Yeah. Okay.  A lot of stress at all."
"30","  Just overall job."
"31","  (Laughs)  I think you need a better construction crew, it's almost literal fires."
"32","  Yeah, okay.  How's your ________"
"33","  Hey, I'm with that."
"34","  That's perfect.  That sounds like the best life.  (Laughs)"
"35","  Okay. Good.  If I was to ask your wife how you were doing, what would you tell me?"
"36","  (Laughs) Okay."
"37","  Okay.  Yeah, but she hasn't been nagging at you, saying, hey, I'm worried about this or anything."
"38","  Okay, so she is a little worried."
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Okay."
"41","  Or die.  I'd be more worried about dying."
"42","  (Laughs) Okay.  And I saw something about how it's getting harder for you to kind of stand or stay standing for more than a couple of hours."
"43","  okay.  Do you feel kind of like zingers almost, like it feels like someone's like shocking you?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Yeah, just kind of that."
"46","  Okay, okay.  Is something getting worse over the last couple of months?"
"47","  Okay, okay.  And have you noticed yourself kind of tripping or falling more?"
"48","  Okay, okay.  And I know one point in time, we said that you had some high blood pressure. Have we checked that lately?"
"49","  No.  Okay.  Do you ever get headaches?"
"50","  Okay.  But not feeling kind of like you're just your head is throbbing. "
"51","  Okay.  And then have you noticed any kind of sores or you have maybe like stubbed your toe or something and it's taken longer to heal?"
"52","  Okay.  Any pain in your chest at all or feeling like it's hard to catch your breath?"
"53","  And when you're on a job site, are you able to kind of like walk upstairs or climb a ladder, do what you need to?"
"54","  Okay.  Are you?  Is there a reason you're kind of avoiding it or…"
"55","  Hey, that's perfect.  You don't know."
"56","  Perfect.  You need to teach me how to.  I need to learn from you how to do that.  The delegation part is always hard."
"57","  Oh, that would be hard."
"58","  That's it, yeah, I like that, and are you taking those meds twice a day like they were prescribed?"
"59","  Okay."
"60","  Hey.  It's so hard to remember them, especially when you've been healthy your whole life and all of a sudden like, hey, take these."
"61","  Yeah, no, it's hard.  The reason I'm asking is I'm wondering if some of the balance and kind of those zingers that you were talking about in your legs, sometimes we see that when your sugar is getting higher consistently and with the metformin, it's a good medicine, but what we found is some people can tolerate it really well, some people don't."
"62","  So, have you noticed any like diarrhea or constipation at all?"
"63","  Okay, okay."
"64","  Okay, because I'm tempted to say twice-a-day medications are really hard to do, especially if you're busy and you're going from site to site, everything else.  I would be interested in increasing your metformin dose and just doing it once a day.  So, doing 1000 milligrams, say at night before bed or in the morning."
"65","  Okay."
"66","  Yes and I think that let's start there and let's say no to the glipizide for right now.  I know your A1c's kind of been rising."
"67"," Yeah, I think the last one I saw was like 7.9 and I think _______"
"68","  Yeah.  So, I think let's up the metformin dose and see how you tolerate it.  Some people will have a little bit of diarrhea, which honestly that's why I say take it at night, you know."
"69","  Yes, exactly."
"70","  And let's hold off on the glipizide right now because if we are using the glipizide consistently, it can kind of ________ a little bit and change your energy."
"71","  Your lifestyle."
"72","  Yeah."
"73","  Okay.  But I am going to warn you, I want to see you back in like three months.  So, I want to give this three months to see what's going on."
"74","  Okay, I'm saying we both give the same information."
"75","  (Laughs) If we have your permission, will do that."
"76","   Okay.  And then in the meantime, we'll make sure you get another prescription for those lancets for those."
"77","  And if you could take your, are you taking your sugars like once a day, every other day?"
"78","  Okay.  How about _______"
"79","  Yeah.  I'm going to challenge you to something."
"80","  Do you make the coffee in the morning or do you make it at night?"
"81","  Okay.  So, can you put your glucometer in those test strips right by the coffee pot?  And every morning, can you take a sugar before you go to work for me and write it down?"
"82","  And then…"
"83","  And then let's try and do one at night when you take your pill also."
"84","  Okay, perfect.  And then, we'll see kind of where you're at in three months. And I might have somebody from my office call you in like a month and just say, hey, how your sugars have been over the last month and we'll take that."
"85","  Okay, that way it's not a ton of work on either of us, but ________ doctor have you taken pills all the time?"
"86","  Yeah."
"87","  The other thing I want to ask you about is, how has your vision been lately?"
"88","  Okay."
"89","  When was your last eye appointment?"
"90","  Perfect."
"91","  Yeah, good.  So, I'll give you a little, one of our little like, pieces or tidbits that we like to say, it is sometimes one way that we can tell how somebody's sugars are doing in their body is how their eyesight is.  So, if you go to your doctor in a couple of weeks, your eye doctor and he says, hey, we need to up your prescription, don't be alarmed.  But I also have found that people who take their metformin consistently and at that 1000 milligrams every night have found that their vision kind of clears up a little bit because you get so much sugar and you don't really notice it because it's been gradual, but all of a sudden you're."
"92","  Feeling that right or you're not as feeling as comfortable seeing distance and stuff.  So that's another reason for let's watch this sugar a little bit closer because we know the closer we get it to that 7.4, the 7%, the better your vision is."
"93","  And, then it also helps with kind of the energy and feeling numb tingly, that kind of stuff.  Umm, so I'd say let's do this little change for right now."
"94","  Stop taking the glipizide.  We'll do 1000 milligrams of the metformin every night and we'll take a sugar as best as you can, a sugar in the morning."
"95","  Perfect.  How's that sound?"
"96","  Okay.  Any questions at all for me?"
"97","   Okay, okay, well, I'll let you get back to your busy day and thanks for taking some time to meet with me."
"98","  Yeah.  We'll see you in three months."
"99","  Don't be alarmed if someone reaches out before that, okay?"
"100","  Okay.  Sounds good.  It was nice seeing you, Freddie."
"101","  Bye, bye."
"102","  Yeah. "
"103","  (Laughs)"
