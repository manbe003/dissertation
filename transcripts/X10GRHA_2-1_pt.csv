"1","  How are you?"
"2","  Yeah, same here.  Sorry about the challenge here."
"3","  (Laughing)"
"4","  Very much so. Very much so, yes."
"5","  Well, I have been doing okay.  A few years ago, I was diagnosed with diabetes and so I know I am supposed to come in every 4-6 months, but it has been just about a year since I have been in, so I need to get started again and so that is why I am here.  Hmm hmm."
"6","  No, that is primarily it.  I really would like to control my diabetes with medication, but other than that I am okay.  Hmm."
"7","  Yes, yes, hmm."
"8","  I really do not know.  I have been thinking that maybe I am just getting older and maybe I am getting ready to die and you know, that is the concern, so.  (Laughing)"
"9","  Okay, okay."
"10","  Well, it is, I would say probably for the last few months, and it is just something that is.  I just do not feel my energetic self anymore, so and the diabetes may have something to do with that and the only other issue that I may have is that I have frequent urination and so.  Hmm."
"11","  I would say probably a little worse.  Hmm Hmm."
"12","  None.  None that I have noticed.  Hmm."
"13","  No."
"14","  No, neither of those."
"15","  Ah, yes.  I would say yes.  Uh-huh."
"16","  Well, I have just thought it, you know, a few months back of walking, my wife and I just walked maybe 10-15 minutes, about twice a week."
"17","  It has not changed much.  One of the reasons that I am meeting with you now is my last doctor recommended that I change my diet, but that is so hard for me to do because my wife, she prepares all the meals and I just do not have time to kind of figure that out so that is where I am on that.  Hmm Hmm."
"18","  Yes.  Hahaha."
"19","  Well, I would say that I am trying to manage it with just the medication that I am currently on and I would like to see if you would recommend to continue with that or I do understand that you know, my numbers are going up a little bit but you know that is to be expected, I would say, with age.  Hmm hmm."
"20","  Hmm, hmm."
"21","  Hahaha.   Yes."
"22","  I take them daily but every about once every two weeks I may miss a dose, you know, trying to rush out the door or something like that I just simply would forget to take it but generally I try to take it on a daily basis.  Hmm hmm."
"23","  Hmm hmm."
"24","  Okay, that that would be a consideration.   I just do not have a plan for doing a better job of managing the diabetes and so if you recommend, you know maybe an increase in the medication, I am willing to give that a try.   Hmm hmm.  Any side effects to that? Any adverse side effects?"
"25","  Uh, no.  When I was first diagnosed, when I came in, I had some tingling in my legs, but they have gone since I have been taking the medication, it is gone away, so."
"26","  Hmm."
"27","  Hmm."
"28","  Yes.  Hmm."
"29","  Hmm."
"30","  Hmm hmm."
"31","  Okay, okay, alright."
"32","  In terms of my A1c's?"
"33","   I know they are gradually going up and you know it is in the yellow zone, but it has not I mean not that is like glucose I am sorry but at 7.9, when it gets 8 and above I think I would really start being really concerned, okay?"
"34","  Hmm."
"35","  Right.  Hmm hmm."
"36","  Hmm, hmm."
"37","  Sure, that sounds like a plan.  Hmm."
"38","  You are right.  I was going to say, would you? Hahaha."
"39","  Hahaha."
"40","  And maybe your way was better than the other way, but who knows. And your blessing?"
"41","  Right.  Hahaha."
"42","  Sure, hmm, hmm, okay."
"43","  I think so, I was just really concerned that you were going to recommend insulin which would I know would drastically change my lifestyle and right now I am so busy working and you know, trying to keep up with the grandkids and etc., that insulin would be just not the greatest idea in the world for me right now."
"44","  Hmm hmm."
"45","  Okay, okay."
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Right"
"48","  Oh, okay, okay, alright.  Well, then that is good news, that is good news.  Hmm hmm."
"49","  Well, again, it has been about a year since I have been in and I just wanted to make sure that everything was going okay and then like I say I was not just becoming an old man and afraid of dying really soon so but I think your recommendations are good and I at least give it a try."
"50","  Okay. The same thing with meeting you and so I look forward to setting up an appointment and we will get the labs and things done."
"51"," Bye, bye."
