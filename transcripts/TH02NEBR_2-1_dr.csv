"1","  Hello, Freddie.  I think you are still on mute."
"2","  That is. Thank you."
"3","  My name is Julie.  I am a fourth-year medical student.  It is nice to meet you."
"4","  Sounds like you are coming in for a routine visit.  Any concerns or things you wanted to address in this visit today?"
"5","  Yeah definitely.  Hmm.  Why do not you start with it sounds like this fatigue.  What is it like?  Is it like you are just really tired or you are actually feeling weak?"
"6","  Yeah.  I saw that okay, so you have had diabetes.  Any other?  Aside from blood pressure."
"7","  What medications have you been taking in this year than in the past year?"
"8","  Okay.  And have you been checking blood sugars at home?"
"9","  215 okay and do you find your sugar levels when you check them are pretty consistent or how do they run, high or low?"
"10","  Hmm.  That makes sense and when they do, for example, like have you had periods of time within the past few months where you were running really low or you were running really high and needed to come into the hospital?"
"11","  Okay, okay, I always like to check, so I am not missing anything."
"12","  Okay, so around 215, is that where you usually are?"
"13","  And any other medications that you are taking right now?"
"14","  Okay."
"15","  Yes, that is very reasonable and when was the last time you checked your A1c?  Do you recall?  Because I do not see it here, but…"
"16","  Okay.  Yeah, and would you be okay like checking it again today, doing some labs."
"17","  Yeah, I think it would just be helpful just to trend those even though you are right, your A1c is not terribly high, it is because it is climbing up, we always check it."
"18","   Okay, any chest pain in the past month or so…"
"19","  Okay, any like shortness of breath or it is like really hard to breathe?"
"20","   Okay.  Any like leg swelling or…"
"21","  Yeah, yeah, all those grandchildren must keep you busy (laughs)"
"22","  Okay, but yes, I can imagine that not having energy kind of limits the things you would want to do in your day.  That is understandable.  Okay and then any changes in terms of your diet or things that you have been eating?"
"23","  Okay, some nice home cooked meals then?"
"24","  Yeah (laughs) and then in terms of activity level, what is that looking like day-to-day?"
"25","  Okay, that is right and I only ask about those two things because those are two things we know that help with blood sugar controls and blood sugar is kind of, what I am thinking of in terms of why you are feeling so low energy, but it also could be other things, so any recent sick contacts?"
"26","  Okay, like any recent fevers or chills or coughing?"
"27","  Okay and have you received your COVID vaccine?"
"28","  Is that something you are interested in?"
"29","  Okay, okay.  Well, we always offer it if that is something you are interested in."
"30","  Umm, okay, so I think where we can really start, especially since it has been a year or over a year is we can start with checking those labs for your A1c and just like your basic labs, so sugar levels, electrolytes, you can also check since we are already checking, you can check like a cholesterol level as well,"
"31","  If you are interested in that since it has been a while and we can kind of go from there.  If it does look like your sugar levels are still running kind of high or your A1c continues to climb, we can start adjusting your medications or, you know, talking about whether you can incorporate more lifestyle changes if that is something more of what you are interested into."
"32","  Yeah, it is always challenging trying to make lifestyle changes when you are already so busy."
"33","   So, we can kind of start from there.  Does that sound reasonable?"
"34","  And again, because 200 blood sugars are a little above what we would like ideally have you like that target range, we would have you in.  Any changes you can make would be lovely."
"35","  (laughs) before we start adjusting and then again, we can always it looks like you are on metformin and glipizide, so we can kind of see what we can do around those.  Any questions about that?"
"36","  Aging, as in your fatigue or…"
"37","  Yeah, so again, of course, as we get older, there is a lot of changes that your body goes through.  When I am thinking of your fatigue and your low energy, I do not necessarily think getting older would cause that.  I do think something is probably going on it.  The first thought I have is your blood sugar levels are directly like so closely related to those energy levels, and so, I am glad you are not ignoring it and you are coming in. "
"38","  I do not think you are like actively dying or going to die anytime soon."
"39","   But I think that is why it is really good to just check all the other labs because there are other things that could go on to whether that is an infection, maybe you got sick and/or you know with diabetes comes increased risks of other diseases, so other organs can also be damaged like you said, you kind of have that tingling in your legs when you first got it, but things like your eye health, your heart health and your kidney health, they are like the main things that I would be checking for."
"40","  Yeah."
"41","  Yeah, it definitely can be related to any of those.  So, for example with diabetes, your kidneys can kind of take a hit from that and so with the lab draw, we can check to see how your kidney is functioning, whether it is seems like it is kind of getting worse.  Is the increased urination like going along with like burning pain or does that hurt when you urinate?"
"42","  It would be, it would be annoying and frustrating to have to go all the time.  So, two things, when your blood sugar levels are high, you might have to urinate a lot more frequently and so that could be one thing, so we want to make sure we find a way to lower your blood sugar levels and whether that is adjusting your medications or adding on another medication if you are interested in that, but we try to avoid it as much as we can, and then another thing I was thinking is even though you are not having pain with urination, you could also have a urinary tract infection and that would make you urinate pretty frequently.  How long have you had these urinary symptoms?"
"43","  Okay, so it is kind of been a while. "
"44","  Okay, so most likely high blood sugar levels are making you urinate more frequently, and we can try to get taper those down a little more just so you are not having a high blood sugar more often than not.  If you are interested, we also can test for a urinary tract infection as well.  You can pee in a cup."
"45","  That is also something we can do, too."
"46","  Yeah, that can be really annoying.  Let us try to get that.  Let us try to get your blood sugar levels down and you can kind of start today even with like you know carb counting type of things, so making sure your diet is more vegetables than not, protein is helpful too and then after we kind of get your A1c in and all those labs back, we can start adjusting medications if that is where we need to go.   Does that sound okay?"
"47","  Of course, if there is any time where you start feeling worse or your urination, you are getting confused or urinating way more, do not hesitate to go into like urgent care or the emergency room because your blood sugar levels might be really high and we can help with that, hmm.  I would not sit on it."
"48","  Okay, we will get those labs, you can work on any lifestyle changes you can make will be helpful."
"49","  (laughs)"
"50","  I know (laughs)"
"51","  Hmm."
"52","  Yeah."
"53","  Yes, of course and with the labs, we will check, you know your A1c will check your kidney function through the creatinine."
"54","  And we can also check like lipid levels too."
"55","  Just to get an overall picture of where you are at since it has been a year.  Any questions about that?"
"56","  Yeah, they sound fun (laughs).  So, lot of energy though, but yes, let us try to get, let us try to tailor all of those things together, so you are feeling better and your blood sugars are, you know, not running as high."
"57","  It was lovely meeting you."
"58","   Yes."
"59","  Alright."
"60","  I know, so many buttons (laughs)."
"61","  Oh no (laughs)."
"62","  You too (laughs)."
