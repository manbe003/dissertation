"1","  Hello, Mr. John, I think you are muted.  Are you able to unmute yourself?  I might be able to.  I cannot.  Kill microphone icon.  Should be in the bottom left.  There you go."
"2","  Alright. Can you hear me alright?"
"3","  Alright, well it is great to meet you.  My name is Tessa Moore.  I am a family medicine doctor.  Nice to meet you.  I am a family medicine doctor."
"4","  And it is Freddie.  What you like to be called?"
"5","  Right.  Well, how are you doing today?"
"6","  Alright.  Well that is great."
"7","  Well, we cannot all be perfect.  I am glad you are here now."
"8","  Is there anything going on that you are particularly worried about?"
"9","  Hmm hmm."
"10","  Okay.  How long this has been going on?"
"11"," Okay.  Do you think this has been months?"
"12","  Okay.  It kind of creeped up on you."
"13","  Okay.  Do you feel like you have had any other changes around the same timeline in your health?"
"14","  Are you peeing a lot during the day? At night?"
"15","  Both okay.  How often are you getting up at night?"
"16","  Two or three times, okay.  Okay.  And then what about other symptoms like?  You find you are really hot or you are not able to control your body temperature as well."
"17","  Okay.  Any changes in your hair or fingernails getting drier and more brittle?"
"18","  No.  Okay.   And how do you feel like your sleep has been?"
"19","  More tired. Are you waking up feeling well rested, or are you still tired in the morning?"
"20","  Hmm hmm.  Okay, what time are you going to bed?"
"21","  10"
"22","  Are you having any trouble falling back to sleep?"
"23","  Okay and then what time do you get up in the morning?"
"24"," 6, Okay, so quite a bit of time at least enough time in bed.  Do you ever wake up with like, morning headaches?"
"25","  Okay, dry mouth?"
"26","  Okay and then has anyone ever told you snore or stop breathing in your sleep?"
"27","  Okay, okay.  Those are all things for sleep apnea which can cause kind of increased fatigue during the day, so we want to make sure that you are getting good quality sleep and that that is not the problem. "
"28","  Okay.  How has this increased fatigue affected your life?  You talked about not playing with the grandkids as much. Are you doing fewer activities? Are you struggling at work? How else?"
"29","  Hmm hmm"
"30","  Yeah."
"31","  Yeah, that is the key question, Okay.  When you go on your walks, do you have any like new shortness of breath, chest pain? feeling like you cannot walk as far as you are used to."
"32","  Okay.  But you do not have any difficulties with that?"
"33","  Okay.  And then as far as your diabetes goes?  Alright. The last A1c I have from you was just over a year ago.  Does that sound correct?"
"34","  Okay.  And at that time it was 7.8, which is still a little elevated."
"35","  I have a 7.4 from August 2019 and then actually it is a 7.9 from March 2021. "
"36","  Okay.  "
"37","  Okay.  Alright.  Well, even in the 7 range, I feel like we can strive to get it even lower.  So and partly fatigue might be from higher sugars.  It also can cause you to urinate more frequently, so if you are getting up more at night, it could be disrupting sleep, which is causing some increased fatigue. "
"38","  So I think definitely getting some labs to look at your A1c would be worth it.  I think it would also be worthwhile looking at your thyroid to make sure that that is not playing a factor.  Have you ever had your thyroid checked?"
"39","  Okay.  That is also just a blood test, so that would be called TSH, just to make sure that that is functioning because that can sometimes cause fatigue and then also worthwhile just to get kind of a blood counts we call CBC to look at your different blood cell levels to make sure that you are not anemic or have something else going on that could be causing some fatigue."
"40","  Okay.  Have you had any like fevers that are unexplained night sweats?  "
"41","  Nothing else going on and no like blood in your stool."
"42","  Okay, okay.  Well, I think those are all a great place to start to just kind of get some baseline labs to see if there is anything going on that could explain this.  I think as you said earlier, trying to figure out what is aging versus this is a little abnormal and I think we are maybe in a little bit of the abnormal range and that we could get you feeling a little better."
"43","  Just to make sure that you know you have the energy to play with your grandkids and everything if we "
"44","  we can help that (laughing)"
"45","  So I will put in orders for those lab tests. You can just go to the lab anytime and they will do those draws and none of those are fasting."
"46","  You can go anytime and do those and we will look at those and then we will touch base after I get those back to see if anything was abnormal that we need to address in those.  If so, we will treat that.   Otherwise, I say, we meet again and pursue you know, some other things to make sure that we are not missing anything.  How does that sound? "
"47","  Okay.  Any other questions or concerns today?"
"48","  Okay and then I think also with that A1c depending on what it looks like, we might want to make some medication changes to see if we can get that number down if it is still in the mid, top or 7 range."
"49"," Okay."
"50","  Fantastic.  Okay.  Are you on my chart, the online system communicate."
"51","  OKAY, well when I get those results you probably will see them first, but I will review them and send you a message and then we can schedule a followup appointment based on what those look like."
"52","  All right.  Well, it was fantastic meeting you."
"53","  And I will talk to you again soon."
"54","  Bye."
