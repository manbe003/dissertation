"1","  Hi Tom.  Hi, can you hear me?"
"2","  Can you hear me okay?"
"3","  Oh, good.  How are you doing today?"
"4","  Okay.  Is that coffee in your mug or what are you drinking?"
"5","  Good, good.  So, I ran a little bit about you.  Do you mind telling me what brings you in today? What do you want to talk about?"
"6","  Why?  What makes you think she is worried?  Have you had like a recent exposure?"
"7","  Okay.  When did the cough start?"
"8","  A few days?  Anything else you have noticed with the cough like a fever, chills, sore throat, anything like that? "
"9","  Yeah, have you been able to check your temperature? "
"10","  No, okay.   Have you had this cough before or is this pretty, pretty new for you?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Yeah."
"13","  Are you worried that you have COVID or do you think it is something else?"
"14","  Yeah.  Do you overall feel well, like you just have a cold and whatever it is, you will just get over it on your own or is there something else you want to do for it, if that is a possibility?"
"15","  Okay. "
"16","  Yeah. Any, any recent weight loss that you have noticed?"
"17","  Appetite changes like you do not want to eat or anything like that."
"18","  Okay.  Any, any night sweats or trouble sleeping that is new for you."
"19","  Sleeping more, okay.  Has the cough been getting better or worse or kind of staying the same?"
"20","  Half white mucus, okay.  Has anyone else around you have been sick with COVID, or sick at all?"
"21","  Have you ever had COVID before?"
"22","  Are you vaccinated?"
"23","   Okay. Do you mind if I ask why you did not get vaccinated?"
"24","  I see.  So if you want to know if it is COVID or not, there is definitely things we can do. You can get tested just at home as a first step. Is that something you are interested in doing?"
"25","  Yeah and that will be a very easy screening.  You do not even have to come in.  You can just buy a screening test at the store and do it yourself.  If that is negative, it is usually a pretty good chance that you probably are negative and we do not have to, you know, think that hard about COVID, again think about some other things like just having a flu or having a cold."
"26","  It does not sound like you have had any other serious symptoms really, other than the cough."
"27","  So. I think you are overall pretty healthy.  Are you taking any medications for the cough?"
"28","  Okay.  Do you take any other medications other than DayQuil?"
"29","  No, okay.  Overall pretty healthy.  Well, yeah, that sounds like a good plan to me if you are up for it. Do you need anything else to help your symptoms or do you feel like the cough is pretty manageable?"
"30","  Right.  Are you having any trouble breathing or any chest pain?"
"31","  Okay.  Do you have any big plans on going out?  Are you, do you go to a lot of restaurants or things like that during your day?"
"32","  Are you working? You are working right now?"
"33","  What do you do for work?"
"34","  Okay.  Or is that usually like indoors on a lot of people?"
"35","  Do you wear a mask when you are at work or at McDonald's."
"36","  Yeah, okay.  I would say if you are okay with it, I would generally recommend a while before you test negative for COVID at home, I would wear a mask and try and stay kind of isolated as much as you can just so if it is COVID.  It sounds pretty mild, but just so you do not have to give it to anyone else who maybe does not handle it as well as you are handling it."
"37","  Okay.  So great.  Do you need any help getting a test? Do you know where to go?"
"38","  Okay.  And uh. Let us see.   Do you have any other questions or concerns for me?"
"39","  If your cough gets worse, if you feel feverish and you check your temperature and it is I would say above 100.  If anything like that changes or you develop chest pain or shortness of breath, I would definitely call the clinic or call 911.  It sounds like you said you are tired more often. "
"40","  Did that start at the same time as the cough or has that been going on a little bit longer?"
"41","   Yeah.  Do you feel like if you had a ballpark, has it been weeks or months or days?"
"42","  Have you been to a doctor's office recently or in the last couple of years to get checked out? "
"43","  Okay.  Uh.  I know you are not on any medications; you seem pretty healthy I would recommend you know to get tested for COVID.  I think that is a good first step and if you are up for it coming in to the clinic for a full evaluation where we can maybe get some blood work just so we have a baseline to know where you are.  Is that something you are okay with? "
"44","  Okay.  So why do not you do the tests and update me on the results.  If it is positive, obviously I will give you some more information about what you can do.  If it is negative, we can set up for followup in person."
"45","  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Any other questions you have for me?"
"46","  Okay.  Well, if that is it, I will just have you the test and contact the clinic with your test results and then we will go from there and schedule a clinic visit."
"47","  Okay.  Well, it is good to see you, Tom."
"48","  Thanks.  Bye."
