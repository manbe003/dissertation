"4","  Hi, Kasey."
"5","  Great.  Good to see you."
"6","  No but I used computers but I don’t use ones without a mouse, this is just a stupid thing here that you have to move everything around and then you end up punching the wrong thing, the next thing you know you are somewhere else."
"7","  Yeah, I can see you."
"8","  Yeah."
"9","  Yeah, well the thing is I know I am supposed to be in every four months or so to you know checkup my diabetes and stuff but I haven’t been for about a year and so I want to take care of my health, that's all.  Here I am."
"10","  So, 2014 so eight years so about yeah."
"11","  Well it was good to you know get diagnosed and then get some, I've been on these meds and they've been pretty good for me so I've been pretty happy so far for the most part."
"12","  Well I thought it was only once a day but well you say twice, I've been taking it once a day."
"13","  Yeah, pretty much, yeah."
"14","  Well, you know every once in a while kind of miss the dose every couple of weeks or so but most of the time I am all right on there yeah."
"15","  Well, mostly I've been keeping things under control but the last few months I've been just so tired it’s, I think that’s the thing I am worried about the most is not having enough energy.  I don’t know, I get home from work and my wife takes care of our grandkids, you know the kids are working and when I get home she usually turns them over to me so I can play with them while she is getting dinner ready and stuff and lately I've just been so tired, it's just really hard to enjoy that time with them and that's one of my main goals."
"16","  About that, I don’t know, four, five months maybe."
"17","  I haven't kept track of it exactly but just running out of steam I guess you know."
"18","  Well you know I just kind of dozing off in the afternoon, it’s I get real sleepy in the evenings."
"19","  I am just running out of energy you know."
"20","  No."

"23","  Yeah."
"24","  Yeah, yeah, that's a good way to put it."
"25","  Oh, yeah, I do that twice a week."
"26","  Yeah, today is Tuesday right, so yeah, this morning I checked it is 215."
"27","  I don’t know somewhere, usually it is not over 200, it is usually about short of 200 somewhere."
"28","  Little bit high today I guess but…"
"29","  It could be but I have to check the log on that, I keep that at home you know so I had to stay at the office to use the computer so."
"30","  But I could check that log and see I mean, I've been doing this for a while."
"31","  Yeah, and I've been watching this keeping it below 8 which is the kind of like the ceiling I've been worried about so doing my best to keep it below 8."
"32","  No, I had to change providers.  My last provider was – anyway she told me I couldn’t have fried chicken on the weekends and I mean that’s ridiculous that’s a family tradition we have a big get-together the whole family comes on Sunday and that's what we have and so I just – I haven’t been back there for a while.  I think I'll try a new provider and I've got Premera Blue Cross so it covers whatever, you know it is through my employer."
"33","  Okay, well that's good to know.  I appreciate that."
"34","  Oh, cholesterol I don’t know what that reading is now, I think I've done that for a while."
"35","  Well I live in Columbia City and I work downtown so what's the most convenient, which clinic should I go to, where are you located?"
"36","  Yeah, it sounds great."
"37","  Yeah, I guess I just thought I was doing what they told me to do so."
"38","  Yeah."
"39","  Okay.  I just wonder you know I see these things on TV like some ad during the news for Ozempic I think it is called I mean what about these – could I take things like that in addition to what I am taking or are those, is a drug like that a good choice?"
"40","  Well that's where she is getting kind of out of hand and I mean I can do certain things but I mean I just eat what's fast and easy and good and I don’t really see how I am going to change that.  I can get more exercise, I've been doing more exercise."
"41","  So but I am not sure about fried chicken - I am not going to change that."
"42","  Okay."
"43","  Well yes, it sounds good."
"44","  Oh, I don’t think I know what I am supposed to do, what did you say?"
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Oh, right I remember that now, yeah, okay good."
"47","  Okay, yeah, great and you are going tell me where the closest lab is for me to go to I remember that yeah, great."
"48","  Okay."
"49","  No, that sounds good."
"50","  Well that's sounds great.  I just, am I just getting to be an old guy or I am about to croak you know I am just kind of in that sort of limbo I don’t know what's going on."
"51","  All ready, it sounds great."
"52","  I can't think of any other ones, no."
