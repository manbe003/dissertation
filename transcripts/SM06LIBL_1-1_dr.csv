"1","  Hello, Tom Johnson.  Oh, I am so sorry.  I can’t hear you right now.  I wonder if you are muted.  I think you might be muted there.  There should be a little microphone down the bottom left, click on that."
"2","  Oh yeah, there we go.  Sorry about that."
"3","  It’s going well.  Are you Tom Johnson?"
"4","  All right.  My name is David.  I am here to help and chat with you about whatever your health needs are today.  So it’s nice to meet you and just start up by telling me what you want to check in on."
"5","  Okay.  I got you.  You said you have been feeling like you have had a cold lately.  What kind of symptoms you have been having specifically?"
"6","  Okay, those are the main things.  Also you are not feeling good and yeah we will go through some questions here and see if we can get this sorted out.  Have you ever had COVID before?"
"7","  Okay, gotcha.  And so these symptoms like cough, little bit of fever started just a few days ago or just recently?"
"8","  Couple of weeks.  Okay.  Have you had any fatigue or other symptoms with that as well?"
"9","  Okay.  May be feeling a little more tired than usual?"
"10","  Any difficulty breathing or feeling like you are short of breath?"
"11","  Okay, got you.  All right.  So it’s is two weeks.  It’s quite a long time that you are not feeling too great.  You feel like you are starting to feel better at all or do you feel like you are feeling about the same as you were before?"
"12","  Okay.  All right.  And have you done anything to try to improve your symptoms like any medications or anything like that?"
"13","  DayQuil.  Okay, gotcha.  And have you been taking that for the full two weeks or just recently?"
"14","  Okay, that seems to help at all?"
"15","  Okay, gotcha.  Is this a kind of thing that you ever had happen before where you were sick for two weeks and kind of had like this cough and something like this before?  Oh, I am sorry, I can’t hear you right now.  I am not sure what is going on.  I think, oh, there you go."
"16","  No worries.  Ya, I had just asked is this the kind of thing you ever had happen before?"
"17","  Okay.  When you have had a cold before has it lasted two weeks and kind of been like feverish and that kind of thing?"
"18","  Okay, gotcha.  Now along with these symptoms have you felt like it gets worse when you are lying in bed at night or on your back?"
"19","  Okay.  Have you had any pressure like in your forehead or cheeks or anything like that?"
"20","  Okay, any ear pain, drainage coming from your ears?"
"21","  Okay, all right.  And then have you been around anybody that you know who has had COVID or that has been sick?"
"22","  Have you gotten a COVID test recently?"
"23","  Okay, gotcha.  And have you ever had one before."
"24","  Okay, gotcha.  All right.  Have you ever had any surgeries done like with your sinuses or anything like that?"
"25","  Okay.  Anything else that you were wanted to talk about today?"
"26","  Okay, all right.  And it seems like you said you haven’t been you know really seen a doctor in a little while so is this an issue that you have been able to talk to a doctor about before?"
"27","  Okay, gotcha.  All right.  So it sounds like you are having some diarrhea and it has been going on for quite awhile you said once a week about?"
"28","  Okay, gotcha.  Two or three years once a week and is that diarrhea like bloody at all, dark, tarry, sticky kind of a thing or just normal looking stool?"
"29","  Yeah, okay.  It started a couple of years ago.  Have you tried doing anything with your diet or you change what you are eating or anything that has affected that diarrhea?"
"30","  Okay.  Well, here is, I am just kind of thinking through what we have got going on you know.  I think you have this kind of recent illness for the last two weeks.  This kind of like a cold like you are saying but then you know we have a couple of other things that we could probably work on too like the diarrhea which is kind of a separate issue and may be like a more long-term issue.  So we can tackle these things may be separate amount in our minds and kind of focus on them like one by one.  How does that sound?"
"31","  Okay, all right.  You know I think for your cold symptoms couple of things come to mind with that.  You know I think definitely getting a COVID test is very great idea you know and that is something going around and I think that should definitely be our part of plan.  I definitely want to make sure you don’t have a sinus infection either.  Sometimes especially after getting a cold or something you can get kind of a residual infection in your sinuses and it lingers for you know 10 days or more then you kind of start worrying about that being a problem too and sometimes you know then it needs to be treated with antibiotics.  So that might be something that we would want to think about doing depending on how your COVID test comes back and that’s sort of like the problem that you are experiencing right now like the most recent thing.  But I think that it is great that you bring up the diarrhea because I think that’s chronic things been going on for awhile that we should definitely address too.  So on that note I will just keep asking you a few questions about that symptoms if it’s okay.  Have you had any like vomiting or other GI symptoms you know vomiting, diarrhea, constipation those types of things?"
"32","  Okay, all right.  And no significant like surgeries in the past.  Have you ever had an abdominal surgery done before?"
"33","  Okay, all right.  And it sounded like you haven’t tried any major dietary modifications for the diarrhea but have you tried like taking a medication or anything over-the-counter to improve that?"
"34","  Okay.  Have you noted that that the stool seems to float in the toilet or does it go to the bottom or just normal?"
"35","  Okay.  Sort of not really one way or the other?"
"36","  Okay, gotcha.  All right.  Yeah and have you ever been diagnosed with any illness involving your bowels?"
"37","  Okay, I got you.  Now you said that the last time you went to the doctor about 10 years ago what kinds of issues that you addressed back then?"
"38","  Okay.  I got you.  And you know you came in today are you interested in kind of establishing cares and can you get me up-to-date on all the little things that can really be beneficial for health long-term like would you like to establish care and kind of address these more chronic things?"
"39","  Oh great.  Okay, I think that’s really a good idea.  So many these things if you catch them early you know it can really make a huge difference in your health going forward.  You know so if that’s the case maybe we can get a little bit more information about other things that we might want to address on this visit or may be even in future visits.  One of those things would be that you know right around your age we start screening people for cancer of the colon and it sounds like if you haven’t been there for 10 years you may not have had that.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy or a stool sample done or anything like that?"
"40","  Okay, gotcha.  All right and you know a lot of times the best way to tackle these things is to kind of make a plan going forward but not necessarily hit everything all in the same visit.  So may be what we can do today is focus on your current cold problem your symptoms you are having right now and then kind of make a plan for going forward from here how we are going to address the other things as we go along.  Is that sound like a good plan?"
"41","  Okay, all right.  I like that.  Well that’s the case then you know some of the screenings like the colon cancer screening might be something we can talk about at next visit and see if we can line that kind of a thing if that’s something you interested in doing.  We can talk more about like what the risks are, what the benefits are, and why you might want to consider doing that especially just given that you had some diarrhea that might be something you know would be good to kind of get on the calendar and so something to think about for sure.  Let’s see other things to talk that would be just kind of how you are doing like at home and just all things in your life and its stressors can affect how people are feeling all the time like things that are going on your life can affect your health as you know.  So that’s another part of establishing care would just be the make sure that we are on same pages all those things and that I can support you in whatever you have going on in your life.  Do you feel like at home, at work whatever the things have been going relatively low recently or do you feel like there are things that you need to work through or talk about?"
"42","  Okay."
"43","  All right, sounds good.  Yeah, I appreciate that’s the most concerning thing right now so let’s address that issue and then we will make some plans going forward for making sure you squared away with everything you need to be healthy and feeling good.  And so kind of just touching back on the issue you came in for here quick before we can wrap things up.  I think that you know getting a COVID test is going to be like our first step here and we can also test for the flu while we are at it to make sure that you don’t have that as well.  But we do not want to think about antibiotics as well just giving the length of your symptoms and if you are having this fever and this residual cough.  As your cough have been productive or do you cough stuff up?"
"44","  And what’s that stuff about?"
"45","  Okay.  Have you been blown your nose recently?"
"46","  Okay.  And what is that stuff look like when you do blow your nose?"
"47","  Little bit yellowish.  Not green or blood or any."
"48","  Okay.  All right.  These low-grade fevers that you had that those just start two weeks ago or you have been having those longer?"
"49","  Two weeks ago.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, well I don’t think there is really anything else on my agenda.  Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?"
"50","  Okay.  So sounds good to me.  Well, Tom it was great meeting you today and I am so glad you came in.  I think it’s fantastic that you want to establish care here that you want to you know look into different health issues going forward.  I am thinking about the fact that you are having the diarrhea and that something we can address and try to solve going forward.  It sounds like today you mostly wanted to find out about COVID and so we are going to do that and make sure that we know the test results on that.  But I think it’s excellent that you want to kind of approach this and I want to be advocating for your health going forward so want to work as a team and it’s kind of make a plan you know for the future with you know with you as a someone that I am working with."
"51","  All right.  Thank you."
