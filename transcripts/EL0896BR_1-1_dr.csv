"1","  Hi, you must be Freddie."
"2","  So, I am Libby.  I am a third year medical student at UDub doing your virtual visit today.  Do you have any questions about Zoom or anything before we get started? "
"3","  Excellent.  So, I saw in your chart that you are here for it, like routine diabetes visit, and then you have some concerns about some fatigue."
"4","  Yeah, okay, well, tell me more about that."
"5","  Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that a little bit, but I definitely wanted to talk more about how you have been tired, because that can obviously make things a lot harder, both in terms of your diabetes and management, but also you know, your normal every day-to-day life.  If it is okay with you, I might ask you a couple of questions to kind of narrow down where your fatigue might be coming from.  How have you been sleeping?"
"6","  Sleep pretty good, how many hours a night are you getting?"
"7","  Okay.  Yeah, that is pretty good and you wake up feeling rested?"
"8","  You wake up tired? Does anybody share your bed with you?  Do you know if you snore?"
"9","  How you ________ "
"10","  Okay, every now and then.  "
"11","  Do you ever find that you are falling asleep easily during the day?"
"12","  Yeah, fair enough.  What do you do for work?"
"13","   Okay."
"14","  Yeah.  You probably would have a lot of increased stress right now due to Covid."
"15","  Yeah, absolutely.  How has your mood been doing through all of that?"
"16","  How's your mood been doing?  How have you been feeling?"
"17","  Okay, yeah, just kind of low energy overall."
"18","  Is that every day?"
"19","  Okay.  If you kind of had to put a timeframe on when that changed for you, what would you say? "
"20","  Last month or so, okay.  Any other symptoms that you can think of, like numbness or tingling or maybe increased indigestion, anything like that? "
"21","   You are peeing all the time.  Yeah, that could make life difficult too.  Okay, so that we might circle back to that a little bit more at the end, but I did want to make sure that we have time to talk about your diabetes too.  Looks like you have been being followed here at least the last two years for it and you said at the beginning that you saw your numbers gone up a little bit on our last check.  I saw that you take metformin and glipizide.  Does that sound right?"
"22","  And are you taking those every day?"
"23","  How often do you think you miss a dose?"
"24","  Okay.  And have you noticed any side effects from either of those?  Like some people have issues with diarrhea with metformin. "
"25","  Okay.  Any other concerning symptoms?"
"26","  That is fair.  That does sound really annoying.  Do you check your blood sugars at home at all? "
"27","  What kind of numbers do you get?"
"28","  Yeah, which has got to be frustrating, I am sure."
"29","  What about your diet?  Have you changed anything about your diet recently?"
"30"," What kind of foods?"
"31","  Yeah."
"32","  Okay, okay and then kind of lunch and dinner."
"33","   Okay, okay and then what about dinner?  Do you eat at home? "
"34","  That is nice."
"35","  Nice.  That sounds delicious, okay.  So I am hearing a couple of things.  It does sound like your diabetes maybe is not quite as well controlled as it used to be.  Some of it could be that you just need things progress over time, and you might need a little higher dose of your medications."
"36","  Which, just looking at what you are taking, we should be able to do without changing too much, just higher dose pills and then we could talk about some diet strategies that would not involve any major changes, but just cutting back a little bit on the carbohydrates, like the breads and noodles and stuff like that can really spike your blood sugars sometimes."
"37","  We can talk more about that, but I also wanted to make sure that we address your fatigue and the frequent urination.  So just to make sure that I have the complete story on the peeing a lot, is that during the day, at night, about how frequently?"
"38","  And are you able to go right away or you have any, does it hesitate?  Is it hard to get a stream going?"
"39","  Okay, okay.  It is definitely possible that that could be related to some higher blood sugars that you could be having.  Do you have any idea of the numbers you are getting other than the kind of green zone versus yellow zone?"
"40","  Okay, okay, makes sense.  And then, let me think through, let me make sure that I got the whole story here with your increased tiredness, kind of over the last month, you have been feeling more tired than usual, just kind of low energy during the day, feel like you are sleeping okay, but you do snore occasionally, but you are not, like, falling asleep at your desk or anything like that during the day? "
"41","  And then, work has been a little bit more stressful, obviously in the last year due to Covid, but you feel like your mood has been okay?"
"42","  Okay.  You have not felt down, depressed or hopeless at all? "
"43","  Fair enough.  Okay, well, I think that brings us to the end of our visit.  So, do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?"
"44","  Okay, well, if it is okay with you, I am going to go talk to my attending, so that we can come up with a plan to get you feeling better and come up with a path forward."
"45","  Yeah, because it is hard to live life when you do not feel like you have energy.  All right.  One minute ________ "
