"1","  Hi, Mr. Johnson.  Oh, I think, I think you might be on mute."
"2","  Hi, now I can hear you, awesome.  Hi, Mr. Johnson.  My name is Jordan.  It is nice to meet you."
"3","  What do you prefer to go by Sir?"
"4","  Tom.  Okay, great.  All right, Tom.  How can I help you today?"
"5","  Well, I am sorry, you are not feeling well, but I am glad you are coming in.  I am going to ask you a series of questions if that is all right."
"6","  All right.  So, when did this cough start?"
"7","  Okay.  And what else has been going on with this cough and what are their symptoms?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay.  So, it sounds like you are having a cough with some off-white phlegm and you are feeling little more tired.  Have you had a headache at all?"
"10","  Okay.  Any feeling dizzy or lightheaded?"
"11","  If you press on yourself like this or on your cheeks, does it hurt?"
"12","  Okay, good, as you say _______ (Laughs).  There we go.  Simon says over here."
"13","  Are you having any chest pain or pressure?"
"14","  Okay.  Do you feel like you are short of breath?"
"15","  Okay.  How about any nausea or vomiting?"
"16","  Good.  Any heartburn?"
"17","  How you feel like your heart is just beating out of your chest?"
"18","  Good.  Any ear pain or pressure?"
"19","  Okay.  Any difficulty urinating?"
"20","  Okay and any diarrhea or constipation?"
"21","  Okay.  And so once every three weeks, when did that start?"
"22","  Oh, okay."
"23","  Okay.  Did it seem to happen after any one events, like you went on vacation and ate something and got sick or, or did you just notice it three years ago?"
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Okay, it sounds like after that time, it has become your regular or maybe not (laughs)."
"26","  Well, I am glad you are coming in today."
"27","  And anything else like any difficulty walking, any numbness or tingling?"
"28","  Okay, any weakness anywhere like all of a sudden you can't like open a jar?"
"29","  Okay.  Well, that is good.  Sorry to ask you a million different things, things like to get a full picture (laughs)"
"30","  I know the big stuff with COVID, I think you checked no on your intake on the chart we have, but have you lost your sense of taste or smell?"
"31","  Okay, okay.  Have you received any of the COVID vaccines?"
"32","  Okay and do you regularly get your flu shot?"
"33","  Okay, hm, that is okay (laughs).  And have you ever gotten the pneumonia vaccine?"
"34","  Okay.  When was the last time you were sick?"
"35","  Good, good.  That is what I like to hear.  So sounds like you're a pretty healthy guy."
"36","  All right and have you ever been hospitalized?"
"37","  Okay and have you ever had any surgeries?"
"38","  Okay.  Do you take any medication?"
"39","  Nice.  You are just gosh, just too easy (laughs).  Do you take any supplements?"
"40","  Okay, what kind of vitamins you take?"
"41","  Okay, all right.  So, no surgeries, never been hospitalized.  Have you ever smoked?"
"42","  Okay, so never smoked tobacco, any chewing tobacco?"
"43","  Any vaping?"
"44","  Okay.  How about alcohol?"
"45","  Okay and two to three beers.  Is that a day or morning or week?"
"46","  Okay.  So it sounds like so two to three beers a week?"
"47","  Okay, okay, all right and then any recreational substance use?"
"48","  Okay.  Ever any history of substance use?"
"49","  Okay, all right.  Anything else major in your past medical history, you think would be important for me to know?"
"50","  Okay, good, good.  Well, I am sorry, you are not feeling well.  It does not sound like you get a lot of you know, sinus or allergy issues.  I did see that you take DayQuil occasionally, is that for allergies or what do you, or just since you started feeling sick five days ago."
"51","  Okay, okay, all right.  So, like I was saying, sometimes and what I had to do with this, you can get sinus pressure."
"52","  That the sinus infection can be very similar to COVID symptoms.  It does not sound like you are someone that gets a lot of sinus issues or a lot of allergy issues.  It does not sound like this hurts when you do that.  So that is a good sign, usually means you don't have too much mucus causing pressure in those areas, those kinds of sinus cavities we have."
"53","  Yeah, so that is good.  Have you noticed any fever or chills?"
"54","  Okay, all right.  Well, especially living where we are and in the current times, you know, even if you are not having some of these, you know, hallmark symptoms, we call like the loss of taste or anything, I mean I, I can't with a magic wand say you do or you don't for sure have COVID.  Is there any way for you nearby and with where you live to go to a rapid testing center?  A lot of times a lot of pharmacies are having places or there are drive-throughs where you can get the rapid COVID swabs?"
"55","  Okay."
"56","  Umm, we should be able to, I am not."
"57","  (laughs), I wasn't sure with our telehealth if we..."
"58","  (Laughs) If we can, then yes, we will do that."
"59","  I have got you."
"60","  Yeah, that is especially you know, just with the workday."
"61","  And I know at construction sites, I think they are testing you guys everyday to make sure you do not have a fever there, otherwise they won't let you work."
"62","  Being around a lot of people, that is a lot of exposure, so I definitely would say you are at high risk."
"63","  Although with the pandemic that basically everyone is also at high risk, just being around people."
"64","  So, I think it is a really good idea to get you tested.  While we would have you here, if we can do that, I think listening to your lungs would be a big help, you know, obviously, I don't have x-ray vision that would be nice."
"65","  Sometimes, when you get these symptoms, like the cough, not feeling well, you can get pneumonia and there's different types of bugs out there that can cause different types of pneumonia.  Sometimes, you can get a bug that have, that comes on really fast and really hard and you get like 103 degree fever, and you can't do anything, you're just stuck in bed."
"66","  And sometimes, you can have one that is a different bug and kind of a little less strain, that kind of gets you wears you down over time and might not be, might not have as pronounced symptoms, but can still, like still need to be treated."
"67","  Not necessarily go away on its own.  It is a little hard to tell unless I can listen to your lungs."
"68","  The good thing is everything you are telling me it doesn't sound like you know, you have got like full body chills or aches, like you haven't been able to get out of bed.  It sounds like you have still been pretty active, which is a good sign."
"69","  Yeah, okay.  So I think while, while we get that rapid COVID test today, I think it would also be really important to listen to your lungs as well.  Because when you do get sick with one thing, even if it is not COVID, if it is a different virus, sometimes when you do get sick with a virus that attacks your immune system a little bit and weakens it, and that can set you up to potentially get a bacterial infection afterwards.  So, I think it would be a good choice today to listen to your lungs, check your vitals, make sure that your oxygen, this little thing we put on your finger, they can tell us how well you are oxygenating, kind of checking that would be really helpful.  Unfortunately, I can't just with talking to you, I don't have x-ray vision (laughs)."
"70","  If your lungs didn't sound great, I think it would be a good idea, you know, we would probably want to get a chest x-ray, but that would only be once we check your lungs."
"71","  But I think just where you work and in the current times, and just with some of your symptoms, I mean, I think obviously starting with a rapid COVID would be very smart."
"72","  Yeah, and the big thing with that would be just so we know, because if it did come back positive, the big thing would be quarantining.  It sounds, do you live with your girlfriend? "
"73","  Okay.  Well, that is probably not going to change in the next 24 hours, so (laughs)."
"74","  Yeah (laughs) so, if you had it, it is very likely that she would too.  So, it would kind of really the main thing would be, especially with you are working as a laborer, we require you to not go to work."
"75","  Just to prevent the spread to others.  So, that would be our big concern, if it did come back positive would be making sure you and your girlfriend would quarantine for about the next seven to 10 days.  But if they came back negative, then they kind of from what everything you are saying, it sounds like you might have some kind of upper respiratory illness going on."
"76","  We ________ whether it is viral or bacterial, once again, I do not have just you know, with my, I could not just tell that just from looking at you.  But I think listening to your lungs would be really helpful in terms of we need to move forward and just keep checking to see if your oxygen as well."
"77","  Sometimes, with a lot of these, you do not need any extra treatment, it is kind of just rest and relaxing and it sounds like you are a heavy worker all day long.  So, I think the hardest thing is going to be just telling me that you're gonna have to rest (laughs)."
"78","  (laughs) Yeah, so once we get the results of the COVID test, I think that would be really helpful just to kind of tell us how to move forward in terms of where this kind of upper respiratory illness is coming from."
"79","  I also wanted to check in just because you are very healthy otherwise and you don't come in to see a physician a whole lot, which is good and I love that you're healthy, but you know I, I think we can make your quality of life a little better since I have got you here.  I don't love that every three weeks you kind of get this, this diarrhea because I think over time depending on what it is that can also add up to something that can make you feel pretty tired and just not at your, not at your peak health, which is where I want you."
"80","  When you get these episodes of diarrhea, is it one day, multiple days or just one time?"
"81","  And is it ever like an episode of incontinence where you feel like you don't make it to the bathroom or do you feel like you can get there?"
"82","  Okay and this is gonna sound very detailed, but is it, have you noticed the color like is it black or bloody?"
"83","  Okay, okay."
"84","  Yeah, no, it does.  I, I talk about this all day long."
"85","  Probably in too much detail."
"86","  I never, I feel bad because to me this is everything I want to know, but patients are probably like I do not look at it often."
"87","  (Laughs) Have you noticed any major weight changes?"
"88","  Any changes in your weight?"
"89","  Okay, okay.  And you said you don't ever feel lightheaded or dizzy or like you might pass out?"
"90","  Okay, okay.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?"
"91","  Okay and remind me how many years young are you?"
"92","  58, okay.  Has anyone in your family ever had a history of any colon concerns?"
"93","  Okay."
"94","  Okay, no, thank you.  I am, I am really sorry about the loss of your mother, but I really appreciate you telling me that, that is helpful.  Well, as health providers, we recommend starting getting colonoscopies at the age of well, it was 50.  I guess it has recently changed, now it is 45, but an insurance covers it.  Have you ever thought about getting a colonoscopy?"
"95","  Well, good.  That is what I am here for."
"96","  I am going to think about it, your thought, your girlfriend forces you to come in for us to get a swab and then I come in here and I want to just, you know, swab everything."
"97","  (Laughs) Well, that is, that is what happens when us providers get around you.  And I saw that you also were interested in a general this kind of checkup as well."
"98","  It is my young healthy guys like you that I gotta, I gotta look for things to keep you on the healthy track."
"99","  Yeah, I think it would be a really good idea to get a colonoscopy.  Sometimes, I have patients that are very hesitant about getting one of those just because I mean, I know it never, it is obviously not a day at the spa.  But it is a lot better than what it used to be in the past.  We have some other things if you are very hesitant towards getting a colonoscopy that we can do like testing your stool for blood or doing some less invasive things, but my base recommendation is getting the colonoscopy, especially with your family history, I think it is a really good idea and with the symptoms you have been having, I think it could really tell us a lot.  Sometimes, you can have polyps in there that are bleeding or sometimes a little lesions or areas in your colon that could be areas of concern that while they are in there, the GI physician will actually take them out and biopsy them, so you don't have to go in you know, numerous rounds.  While they are in there, they, they like to diagnose, so they get all the samples they need.  So, I think it would be very useful for us just to make sure that everything is okay."
"100","  Yeah, so I think while we check into your rapid COVID, I think it would be a good idea to maybe put a referral in for a colonoscopy."
"101","  Yeah, and when was the last time you had labs, like a normal physical."
"102","  Ho, all right (laughs)."
"103","  (Laughs) Well, I am gonna have you wait here for rapid COVID anyways.  How would you feel today if I took some blood from you?"
"104","  Exactly.  I like to, I would rather be efficient and not make you come back here a million times.  I know, especially with you said with your work schedule, so let's capitalize on the moment even though I wish you were feeling better."
"105","  (laughs) Yes, I think it's a good idea just to get some basic labs and when I say basic labs, we, we check for things like hemoglobin A1c, which is a way for us to check and see your blood sugars.  So, if you had any concerns for diabetes that can be really helpful.  The labs also can show us your kidney function, how your liver is doing.  It can also show us your blood levels, so then we call your hemoglobin, sometimes you can get anemic, which can make you feel pretty tired.  So, I think it would be a good idea to check that as well, especially just with your consistent history of maybe some bowel changes, I think it would be really good idea to look at that.  I tend to check in this area, just as we age, I tend to check thyroid on everyone, although it doesn't sound like you have anything like your heart racing a lot, but sometimes being tired can actually be from a thyroid issue as well."
"106","  Yeah, you know, those are kind of big things I would like to check.  Have you ever had any concerns with like high cholesterol in the past?"
"107","  Okay, we usually check a lipid panel when you have been fasting, but in the interest of just having you here, I think it would be fine checking it today and it wouldn't really alter the numbers too much.  But that can just show us if you have, you know, really elevated cholesterol or something like the levels of the fat in your blood."
"108","  As we age, that can also tend to happen as well.  I know you said you haven't had any significant weight changes, but, but it is common as we age to sometimes gain weight or lose weight, so that can also kind of help us gauge where your health level is.  And we will check your vitals as well when they, when we are checking your lungs, so we can see kind of what your blood pressure, where it is at."
"109","  And that can give us a little more information.  Once I get kind of all these lab results and we figure out when we get your COVID results, like I said, and once we listen to your lungs, we can figure out first, you know, do we need to get chest x-ray, am I worried that this could be bacterial kind of like if we need to do any treatment for you or if your COVID comes back positive, if we need to get a work note, and make sure that you are quarantining."
"110","  And then when your labs do come back, we can talk about any, if there's anything on there that we need to do moving forward as well as that referral to colonoscopy."
"111","  I know it sounds like a lot; I tried to, I am trying to listing kind of just three big things, so that we will address the COVID, potential for COVID today, but your upper respiratory illness whereas, number two is going to be getting your labs and seeing if there is anything we need to look at further there, and three is just that referral to colonoscopy."
"112","  You are a smart man, you know, you know what they say?  Keep happy, happy wife, happy life."
"113","  So, keep the partner happy and I really got you to come in today (laughs)."
"114","  Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today, sir?"
"115","  Yeah, you know, I appreciate you coming in.  I am sorry, like I said that you are not feeling better, but hopefully, we can get you on the right path."
"116","  All right.  It was nice to meet you, sir."
