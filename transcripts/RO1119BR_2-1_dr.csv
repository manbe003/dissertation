"1","  Hi.  Mr. Johnson I think you might be muted.  I think…"
"2","  Yes."
"3","  That’s perfect, thank you.  Mr. Johnson, my name is Anne Hagerty.  I'm a third year medical student at the University of Washington.  What would you prefer to be called today?"
"4","  Okay.  It's nice to meet you.  Tom, what brings you in today?"
"5","  Okay great.  Do you mind telling me a little bit more about the symptoms you've been having?"
"6","  Okay.  And so, just to clarify, no changes in your taste or your smell?"
"7","  Okay.  Any shortness of breath?"
"8","  Any temperature?"
"9","  Okay.  No fever that you know of?"
"10","  Okay.  Let's see, any known exposures that you're aware of?"
"11","  Yeah, that makes sense.  And do you mind my asking if you or her are vaccinated?"
"12","  Okay, perfect.  And this has been going on about five days.  I'm curious, do you smoke? "
"13","  Okay.  Do you have any underlying lung disease?"
"14","  Okay.  And I'm sorry, I can't see this in your chart, but do you have diabetes?"
"15","  Okay, are you on any, let's call -- not that you are aware of, okay."
"16","  Okay, any immunosuppressive therapies such as for cancer or for an autoimmune disease?"
"17","  Okay, okay.  __audio break__ I'm going to __audio break__."
"18","  __audio break__."
"19","  __audio break__ as a medical student I haven’t had too much exposure to COVID as in I haven’t cared for it much.  But I'm going to tell you what's on my mind and to me it seems like you might just have a run-of-the-mill virus.  My Internet, oh, your __audio break__."
"20","  Can you see me?  Tom, can you hear me okay?"
"21","  Tom, can you hear me okay?"
"22","  I'm going to try again.  Okay.  So, Tom, what I was saying moving forward…"
"23","  Okay."
"24","  How about now?"
"25","  Okay.  Well hope that that holds up.  Tom, since you've been sick, have you been seeing other people without a mask?"
"26","  Okay, great then.  So what I was saying earlier when I was breaking up for you is that as a student to be honest I haven't cared for too many COVID patients, but what my initial Gestalt is based on our conversation is that you may just have a run-of-the-mill viral infection, like what we get when we get colds, you know, things that were around before COVID, but I - and so I'm sort of inclined to just see if this clears up in a few days.  But, I understand if it would make you feel more comfortable to get a COVID test, I'm curious what your thoughts are?"
"27","  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think in medicine we try to avoid unnecessary testing, but because COVID can present very mildly in some people and because you are out working with other people, I don't think it's a bad idea for you to get one, especially now that they are more available.  So, I think if you could get one in the next couple of days that would be good.  And do you think you would be able to get one tomorrow?"
"28","  Okay.  Sometimes I think they have drive-up things on weekends or you know pharmacies.  So my recommendation would probably be that you not see anyone between now and then, and you know, ideally you wouldn’t see anyone until you got the test results back since we are, you know, if we're taking it seriously enough that we're getting a test, then I think we should take the precautions as if you were COVID positive at this point, and so I think you should limit your contact with other people.  Is that something you think you could do?"
"29","  So if you got a rapid test, those come back within a few hours and so that would not require you to miss work.  Some of them I believe come back like 24 hours later and so in that case maybe you would miss the first couple hours of work if possible, like if you got it tomorrow morning at 9 and you didn’t hear the results until Monday morning at 9, then maybe that would cause you to go into work a little bit later.  And I could write a note for that if you'd like."
"30","  Okay.  Do you feel okay about the plan that we've discussed?"
"31","  Yeah."
"32","  Okay.  And I just wanted, I'm sorry that I'm putting it on you to do the research.  I want to offer you the resources from whatever clinic I'm working on, but I don't know.  And I think, you know, just something to be aware of is that for COVID the treatment is supportive and so if this cough isn't bothering you, there's nothing to be done that you know to treat you, but you can always try cough syrup or lozenges or something if that will make you feel better.  So just know that we're not neglecting any treatment that you should be receiving if that is any ease off your mind.  Yeah, and then I guess if you, if it turns out that you can't get an appointment for tomorrow, you could send me a secure message, and I'd be happy to write you a note to excuse you from work Monday.  But, I think the chances of that happening are low.  I think you'll be able to get a test tomorrow."
"33","  Does that sound okay Tom?"
"34","  Okay, okay.  It was so nice to meet you and I hope your cough clears up.  I feel fairly confident it's just a run-of-the-mill virus, but I think for ease of mind for your girlfriend and for you getting a test makes sense."
"35","  Any questions?"
"36","  You know, based on the limited knowledge of COVID that I have, I don't have further questions for you, but I do just want to, you know, emphasize again that if you can minimize your contact in the next, with other people in the next 36 hours, I'd really recommend that."
"37","  Well, we have limited time for these appointments and it sounded like this was the highest priority for you, but what's on your mind?"
"38","  Yeah, absolutely.  I think that this would be good to schedule a followup appointment, so that we can spend all of our time on that.  You know, I'd love to just get to know more about your personal health history and it would probably be good to do some general lab testing.  It looks like you had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years?"
"39","  Okay, so you are up-to-date on that, but yeah, I'm sorry, I think that it would be better if we set up a followup appointment.  Will that be okay?"
"40","  Okay.  And I think if possible, if you are COVID negative it would be helpful to do it in person so I can do a physical exam and just make sure everything looks okay from that end."
"41","  I will place some orders for just some general labs and then we can discuss the results of those at that appointment."
"42","  Is that okay?"
"43","  All right, nice to meet you Tom.  I look forward to seeing you in an appointment soon. "
"44","  Thank you so much."
"45","  Bye-bye."
