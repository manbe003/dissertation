"1","  Hi.  My name is Emma Reisman.  How are you doing today?"
"2","  I am doing well.  It is nice meeting you.  Why do not you tell me a little bit about what you are concerned about today?"
"3","  Okay.  And is this something that is new, is it something that has been changing or has it really just been appearing over the past two or three weeks?"
"4","  Okay.  And can you tell me a little bit more about the fatigue you have been feeling?  Describe that a little bit."
"5","  Yeah, definitely that is concerning, and I am glad that you came in with that concern and I am sorry that you have been feeling this way."
"6","  Would you say that the fatigue is more of like a mental fatigue or more of a like muscle fatigue or kind of both?"
"7","  Okay, good to know.  How do you feel like your diabetes is going overall?"
"8","  Hmm hmm."
"9","  Okay.  And I saw that you are taking both glipizide and metformin.  Tell me about how you take those medications?"
"10","  Okay, great.  And do you have any side effects that you notice to either of them?"
"11","  Okay, great.  And then do you check your blood sugars at all while you are at home?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  That is good to know.  So they have been a little high recently."
"14","  And what does your diet typically look like?  Has that changed at all over the past few weeks?"
"15","  Okay.  And you also noticed the frequency in urination.  Can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"16","  Okay.  And when you urinate, is there any odor to your urine? "
"17","  Okay, and have you had, is it painful at all?"
"18","  Do you feel like you can fully empty your bladder?"
"19","  Yeah.  That makes sense.  Okay.  And then have you had any other symptoms besides for the fatigue and urination?"
"20","  Okay."
"21","  No feeling lightheaded or feeling like your heart is beating really fast."
"22","  Any chest pains? Headaches."
"23","  What about the sensation in your hands and feet?  Do those feel normal?"
"24","  Okay.  And have you had any like cuts recently that have not been healing as normal as they typically do?"
"25","  Okay.  That is all good to know.  Just to kind of summarize to make sure that we are on the same page, so you have a history of diabetes.  You are currently taking glipizide and metformin twice a day."
"26","  For the past three weeks, you felt increased fatigue both kind of mentally and kind of musculoskeletal wise, you have also had more frequency in urination.  You have been checking your blood sugars, and they are about 215 fasting."
"27","  Great.  Okay.  Freddie, based on this, I think, you know, there may be something else going on to this fatigue and I think it is worth ordering some blood work and kind of making sure your, you know, that you are not anemic or there is not something related to kind of your cells, your red blood cells.  But I also think that this could be related to your diabetes being a little uncontrolled and the fact that your blood sugars are so high.  And so at this point, I think it would be beneficial if we raise your metformin to the higher dose.  How would you feel about that?"
"28","  Yeah.   So you are currently at 500 mg twice a day, and I think we would bump you up to 1000 mg twice a day."
"29","  And because really we like to have your, your A1c under 7, it is 7.9 and your blood sugars are pretty high in the morning. I think that you could benefit from that and we will see after a few weeks if that is helping with your fatigue and if it is not and your blood work was also normal, then we can do a more thorough work up at that point."
"30"," Do you have any questions for me?"
"31","  Yeah definitely, I am really glad that you came in. I think it is important that we address this and yeah, I will definitely order some blood work just so we will see if there is anything else that is causing it but we will definitely check on your diabetes as well since it has been a while since we have had your last A1c."
"32","  Yeah.  No definitely and I think that you know, the better that we control your diabetes, the longer life you are going to have, and on top of that, while we can make medication changes, diet and exercise will also make a huge difference and so trying to eat a lower carbohydrate diet and exercising more will also help lower your blood sugars, which can be beneficial as well."
"33","  Yeah, that is great. I am glad to hear that you are getting out.  Any other questions before we end our visit today?"
"34","  Okay.  It was great meeting you today, Freddie, and go ahead and sign off, and I will talk to you as soon as I get that lab work back."
"35","  Yeah, have a great day."
"36","  Bye. Bye."
