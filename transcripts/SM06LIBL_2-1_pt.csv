"1","  Hello there.  I know about that and I've been trying to unmute it, but the program has been trying to sign me into a different Zoom meeting and so, I apologize for that.  Anyway, yeah, I'm Freddie Jones.  I'm here to talk to you today.  What's your name again?"
"2","  Great."
"3","  Well, you know, I know I'm supposed to check on my diabetes every four months or so and it's been about a year.  So, I want to take care of my health and so here I am. "
"4","  Mostly it's just making me tired and I kind of just want to raise that energy level a little bit, but I got grandkids to play with.  I've things to do."
"5","  Yeah, that will be the day."
"6","  Yeah, it was like a 7.4 reading there…"
"7","  It was there it was 6.9 and then I guess the next one was 7, and it's up to 7.4, but I think as long as I'm under 8 that's one of my goals is to keep control of it there."
"8","  Well, basically, I prefer making adjustments in the meds and the stuff.  I've been adjusting my exercise program a little bit too, getting a couple of walks and during the week and doing some rounds through the facilities here and getting myself up on my feet and stuff.  So those are my main approaches to it there."
"9","  I don't think I did.  Well, you know, basically my wife does the cooking and I'm not going to argue with that and my last provider really got upset about us having fried chicken on weekends and sort of the reason is I'm changing over here as I want somebody that can actually pay attention to my situation, you know, and fried chicken, I can't believe it.  Anyway, so my wife does healthy, I try to eat healthy and give me the energy to keep up with the kids and the grandkids, yeah."
"10","  Well, yeah, but it's in a way kind of a good thing, because it's a substitute for coffee.  I used to drink coffee all day long and but I just have coffee in the morning now, but during the day I drink coca cola and it gives me that kind of boost that I need in the afternoon and at dinner time have one after dinner or with dinner and maybe makes up for that coffee that I'm not drinking."
"11","  Should I go back to coffee then?"
"12","  Yeah, I guess so."
"13","  Okay, so maybe for the lunch time instead of a coke, I'll get some coffee.  How does that sound?"
"14","  Oh yeah, I like cream and sugar, that's for sure."
"15","  The cream is healthy, it kind of makes a -- keeps the coffee from bothering your stomach, you know, that's what I've been told anyway."
"16","  Good idea, you know."
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yeah, I guess so, yeah."
"19","  Yeah, that's right, yeah.  The metformin is twice a day.  Was it, 500 mg I think and then just glipizide is just 10 mg."
"20","  Oh, well, what I'll tell, I mean I might forget once every couple of weeks or something, but just for the most part, you know, I keep on top of it."
"21","  I keep seeing things on TV that I'm supposed to ask you about, but by the time I get here I forget what they are, so…"
"22","  It seems like they are always changing stuff and making new things worrisome and so I'd really like to, you know, if I can and we can just modify the meds that I’m on and that would be perfect, but I just don't want to end up on insulin, that's one of my main concerns. "
"23","  Maybe, I don't recall the details of that."
"24","  But I guess so if you've got it in my records, I don't remember.  I haven’t checked my blood pressure in a while, so I don't know if that is what you are talking about, but yeah."
"25","  Premera Blue Cross is what I have, so…"
"26","  Yeah."
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Oh diet and exercise, yeah, all right, I just forgot, and the meds.  So yeah, I'll make sure that I keep on that exercise schedule; get a couple of walks in a week that will be good."
"29","  Well, it's not so much that, it's just I get tired, you know, and so things I used to be able to do for long time, I can't do them as long I used to.  And so I guess standing around kind of freezes you up and once you get moving, it's always a little bit better."
"30","  Okay, and it depends on what we did with the coffee."
"31","  Oh, I took my blood glucose this morning, it was about 215."
"32","  I would, but I kind of ran out of supplies, so I can't really test my glucose right now, I used the last of it up this morning."
"33","  You want me to go in there is what you're saying?"
"34","  Oh."
"35","  Well, this is a telehealth visit right, so I'm not in there, so I'm not sure how I am going to get all this stuff from you."
"36","  Yeah, complicates things."
"37","  I got to figure that out, because it's not just me that's involved in the work schedule.  My wife takes care of my daughter's kids during the day when I'm at work, but when I get home then I take over and so I need to, so I'm not going to be there.  I'm going to have to schedule it.  So I guess, can I call in and make and schedule a time?"
"38","  This is a new glucose test right that you're talking about?"
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Well, I don't recall, it's about you know in the low 200s."
"41","  Yeah, I mean, I'm willing to give it a try if you think that's what I should do, yeah."
"42","  That's right, yeah."
"43","  And so we talked about I'll have coffee instead of that coke."
"44","  She is a pretty big one, I mean, it's large, but…"
"45","  It's confusing.  You know, what they call large is as big as a house or I don't understand the sizes, I mean, but I get a big one then -- I usually take it back to work with me and that gives me a little extra walking."
"46","  Yeah, but, yeah, I mean I'm not having that coke now, I'm having a coffee instead, so you want me to have a small coffee or I don't understand?"
"47","  Oh, I see, yeah."
"48","  A medium sized coke or something?"
"49","  I guess I could do that, yeah."
"50","  Oh, yeah, as long as it's enough to, you know, wash down the lunch or whatever dinner."
"51","  That’s okay.  I think it sounds good."
"52","  Good, if you want I guess."
"53","  I guess so, quite a while…"
"54","  Uh-huh, well, if you think that's fine to do, that's sounds good."
"55","  Well, no.  I think doctors have talked about it or something like that I guess I'm getting to that age where, you know to start thinking about those things.  So…"
"56","  Oh I think my dad had colon cancer, I forgot or grandpa.  No, no, no, no, no, nobody I can think of."
"57","  And I guess he just, you know, my dad passed away just a couple of years, or three years ago now of natural causes.  You know, my mom survived breast cancer though, she is still hanging in there in her 80s, but even she's got diabetes like me."
"58","  I guess so, I guess now that it's getting safer to get out and about, maybe I can do that, yeah."
"59","  I missed that by about 10 years."
"60","  No."
"61","  Sounds like a plan.  I mean where do I get this machine though?  I mean, are they expensive or…? "
"62","  Yeah, if you can do that, that would be great.  Just tell me when.  You've got my address that's over in Columbia City.  Anyway, that sounds like a plan, yeah, sure."
"63","  Sounds great, yeah."
"64","  Oh, I can't think of anything.  It seems like we've covered all the bases here."
"65","  Oh, yeah, right, yeah."
"66","  No, no, I take that and I keep taking the same other ones too, the glipizide and the metformin?"
"67","  Okay."
"68","  Great, sounds like it should keep us busy for a while."
"69","  Great, well thanks a lot."
"70","  You too."
"71","  Bye."
