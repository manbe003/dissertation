"1","  Hey Freddie, can you hear me?"
"2","  Hi Freddie, can you…"
"3","  Freddie, can you, hi can you hear me?"
"4","  Hi, my name is Anthony.  I am one of the student doctors or medical students, I will be seeing you today."
"5","  Okay.  Can you see me okay?"
"6","  Yes?  Great.  So before we start, can I just have you confirm your first name, last name and date of birth please?"
"7","  Sorry could you, can you say that again?"
"8","  May 9th 1955?"
"9","  Oh, okay.  Oh, I have a different date of birth."
"10","  Yes I have 04/15/1960.  That’s okay.  I think it is a typo.  All right Freddie, so what kind of brought in today or what kind of brought you to this telemedicine visit?"
"11","  Could you tell me more about that?"
"12","  Could you tell me what numbers you are getting, does it give you a number by any chance?"
"13","  And how long or how long that has that been going on for?"
"14","  How recently would you…?"
"15","  And has anything changed in the last couple of weeks to kind of cause your blood sugar to be going a little higher than usual?"
"16","  Okay.  So what were your sugars looking like before the last few weeks, before the?"
"17","  What was kind of the normal for you?"
"18","  Okay.  Yeah, so have you been, has your diet changed at all that you have noticed?"
"19","  Okay.  Are you still taking your metformin pretty regularly?"
"20","  Most of the time?  Are you missing doses by any chance?"
"21","  Okay.  And then how about your glipizide, how often are you taking that?"
"22","  Okay.  Are you taking any other medications at this time?"
"23","  Okay, got you.  So glipizide you are taking as prescribed and then metformin you miss maybe one dose every few weeks?"
"24","  Okay.  Do you have any thoughts as to why your blood sugar has kind of been going up?"
"25","  Okay.  Let us see here.  I am just taking a look at your A1c over the last few visits that we have and it is kind of have been trending slowly upwards.  Do you remember what your hemoglobin A1c is or what that measures?"
"26","  Got you, okay.  So hemoglobin A1c is kind of like an average blood sugar that, well it is an average of the three-month blood sugar.  I have been seeing is since March 30, 2019, your A1c was 6.9% and it has been steadily increasing to 7.9% which was on the, I guess on March 26, 2021.  So as per using today's data it would be about almost two months ago.  How often are you taking your blood sugar?  Are you just taking it after every meal or?"
"27","  And has your diet changed at all?  Are you eating more carbohydrates by any chance?"
"28","  Oh man, that sounds tasty."
"29","  Oh gosh.  So with that, you haven’t noticed any change in like what you are eating?"
"30","  Okay, okay, got you.  So let me see here.  In terms of your diabetes, if this blood sugar was over the three months, it’s about three months, almost two months, have you been exercising more often?"
"31","  Okay.  And how often are you or how long are you walking for every single time you are out?"
"32","  15 minutes around the neighborhood.  And then let us see.  Is that the only form of exercise you have been getting?"
"33","  So just 15 minutes walking around the neighborhood every or how often are you doing that per day may be?"
"34","  Now I totally understand.  Has work been more stressful lately?"
"35","  Can you tell me what’s going on with work?"
"36","  Got you.  I am so sorry to hear about that, I know how stressful that can be."
"37","  Do you find yourself snacking more often when you are stressed?"
"38","  Got you.  Okay, so if not it is, let us see.  A1c has kind of been going up, we may need to change your medication, just ___."
"39","  Oh, definitely.  So, there are a couple of options to kind of, we get your blood sugar under control here.  One thing I would think about is, just kind of sticking to a relatively low carbohydrate diet or just watching kind of what you are eating and then measuring your sugars.  Are you opposed to that or we could try increasing your exercise too?"
"40","  Yeah, I mean just with your readings, it seems like your sugars are increasing, but we are not sure what’s kind of going on.  I think, well there are always options.  One thing is just may be kind of watching what you are eating and trying to monitor that.  You are only taking 500 mg twice a day and then you are also on glipizide ___.  Yeah, you are on glipizide 10 mg twice daily.  Wait, one second.  So would you be opposed to changing medications or what would you prefer, have you tried to may be monitor your diet, see how that is going when you are trying to, thinking about increasing your exercise or?"
"41","  Is there anything that you kind of wanted to do or any ideas or thoughts towards how you wanted to manage all this by any chance?"
"42","  Totally, yeah.  It seems really hard to control your sugars from time to time and this happens to everyone.  It’s kind of like the natural progression of diabetes where sometimes nothing will change, but your body just reacts the way that it does and the medications do not seem to work as well as it used to, give me one second, maybe we give a try.  And then other than handling the diabetes, I am seeing your chart and it says you have been having more fatigue for the past six months?"
"43","  Could you tell me more about that?"
"44","  Hmmm.  And can you describe this weakness to me?"
"45","  Okay, interesting.  And has anything, like have you had any injuries or traumas recently, have you been walking more often or sitting more often?"
"46","  And then how about any numbness or tingling?"
"47","  So you have just kind of noticed more fatigue and then just weakness in your legs?"
"48","  Do you feel like you are going to just fall over?"
"49","  Right, can you explain to me what you mean by your legs will give out?"
"50","  Okay.  Let us just see.  And how often are you feeling this way?"
"51","  Couple of times a week."
"52","  Oh, more if you are busy.  Okay."
"53","  You note, so couple of times a week.  Does anything seem to help with the kind of weakness that you feel in your legs?"
"54","  Do you ever feel lightheaded or anything like that?"
"55","  No?  Okay.  You just feel like your legs are going to give out and you would kind of just fall over?"
"56","  Okay.  Any, no idea what is causing that?"
"57","  Okay.  I am trying to see.  And how did this kind of leg weakness come on, did it come on randomly or?"
"58","  Gradual, okay.  Did it come on around the same time as your blood sugars kind of going up?"
"59","  Okay, got you.  And I am sorry, when was the last time you were seen in office for a physical exam?"
"60","  Sorry, when was the last time you were seen in the office for a physical exam?"
"61","  Oh gosh, okay.  So given the kind of your rising blood sugars and then also the symptoms that you are feeling with kind of fatigue for the past six months with trouble standing, I definitely would like you to come in and get a physical exam and just kind of get some bloodwork done and then just start off and see how you are doing, does that sound okay with you?"
"62","  I just also want you to come in because it appears that we have not had some lab work done on you for quite a while.  Remember getting like a creatinine by any chance?"
"63","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, there are some labs I would love to get on you.  Do you also get the flu vaccine?"
"64","  Okay, every few years?  Okay.  We highly recommend getting the flu vaccine also because that kind of can be tabled for a later discussion.  And do you have the colon cancer screening by any chance?"
"65","  Have you had any colon cancer screening by any chance?"
"66","  Okay.  Any reason why you have not had colon cancer screening?"
"67","  Hmmm, I don’t necessary think that it could.  There is a possibility that, I do not know, it could have something to do with your sugars, but we always want to make sure that people just get the recommended screening especially, yes especially after age 50, colon cancer screening is really easy to test for and is quite accurate and colon cancer screening can also be quite or sorry colon cancer can be quite devastating and just routinely monitoring for that and watching out for that, we can actually prevent colon cancer or kind of decrease the risk for it.  And so it seems that you since you are around age 50, but you have not had it, so I definitely would recommend it."
"68","  Have you noticed any easy bruising or anything like that?"
"69","  No?  Okay.  Just so, with that, I would definitely recommend having you have some kind of just lab work done.  We will probably check your creatinine.  We would probably do a urinalysis to just see if you are leaking any sugars into your blood or sorry leaking any sugars into your urine, and also just to check kind of your electrolyte levels and see how you are doing with that.  You are not taking any medications for your hypertension, correct?"
"70","  Okay.  And then have you been checking your blood pressure at home by any chance?"
"71","  Okay, got you.  So since it has been I guess a year since you have been, I would definitely recommend that you come in and just get like kind of a physical exam and get some lab work done and we can also talk a little bit more about kind of increasing your medications or changing your medications around to kind of better control your blood sugar?  How does that sound with you?"
"72","  Okay.  Is there any particular reason why you would want to come in and get some lab work done or a physical?"
"73","  Yeah, I totally understand being busy, trying to make time for it.  I guess doctor’s visit and lab appointments is very difficult, but the way kind of your blood sugars are kind of going up and you are feeling this kind of fatigue and trouble standing for more than 2 hours, I definitely would recommend it.  Your health is very important to you and it seems the stressors at work and stuff are kind of having an impact on you.  I just think it would be a good idea if we could kind of schedule something for you and have you kind of come in and get it done."
"74","  Yeah, is there, is there, are there any other barriers to you to just kind of coming in and getting examined?"
"75","  Okay. Yes, so let me see here if.  Yes, before we change any of your medications around, I would actually love it if we could just kind of get you to come in, get some lab work done and then we can further discuss that and we can set medication regimen that sounds good or tolerable to you, because I know taking a lot of medications every day is also quite challenging.  How does that sound?"
"76","  Okay.  In the meantime, would it be okay if we kind of talked a little bit more about your diet?"
"77","  Yeah.  So with diabetes, it’s really hard to kind of control if you are not on like a kind of stable diet, so can you just."
"78","  Oh I like that.  Nothing beats home cooked meals.  So one of the things I think that we can kind of talk about is kind of what your wife is cooking for you and may be if we can make some adjustments from there.  So what is your typical like breakfast or lunch look like?"
"79","  Yeah, so with that we kind of just want to make sure, let me see if I can pull out things simple.  Okay, so it seems that you are not drinking a lot of soda which is great, you are having a diet soda which is actually not too bad, because it does not have any real sugar in it.  But are you eating any processed foods often like?"
"80","  I guess processed foods would be like frozen meals, like cheese burgers from like fast food restaurants?"
"81","  Yeah, yeah, I totally understand.  I know that they are tasty and they are kind of very easy to access, but one of the things that would be easy to kind of control your sugars is kind of reducing processed foods or less fast foods, less frozen foods, more vegetables, and I guess less white rice or white bread or pasta."
"82","  Yeah, yeah, it’s very hard.  Grandkids are lot of fun.  They are high energy."
"83","  ____ them but anything, yeah I think having like one or two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I mean now and then it’s great.  But just with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, the white bread has a lot of carbohydrates and that can kind of cause your blood sugar to fluctuate or cause an increase in your blood sugar.  And some things that we can do is maybe if you want to have those white bread sandwiches or say peanut butter and jelly sandwiches you can cut out carbohydrates in other ways.  So may be just cutting out maybe your cheese burger, if you are going to have like, you can have a pea bean cheese sandwich, maybe just cutting out cheese burger and eating something like more vegetables like broccoli or spinach or green beans those are, I know, how do you feel about vegetables?"
"84","  Yeah.  Have you thought about carbs counting by any chance, limiting how many carbohydrate?"
"85","  Okay.  Do you know what, have you ever heard about carb counting with more?"
"86","  I am not sure.  I think it’s been around for a while, but it’s something people will often sometimes talk about when kind of your blood sugar gets a little bit higher or when you are diagnosed with diabetes and it is just trying to manage how many grams of carbohydrates you kind of consume in a day."
"87","  That’s also very challenging, yeah.  I think what tends to help is sticking to may be a meal plan kind of deal.  Does that sound easy for you or tolerable if your wife is making kind of very similar meals, but?"
"88","  Okay.  Do you have any thoughts or ideas on how you can kind of manage what you are eating to kind of better control like or reduce carbohydrates by any chance?"
"89","  Yeah, yeah, and I am just really worried that your blood sugars are kind of increasing and they are not quite at a level where we would start like insulin or anything yet?"
"90","  Yeah, we will definitely trying to keep you out of that range and so another easiest way is now would be to one, control your diet which is kind of decreasing the carbohydrates, decreasing processed foods, eating more vegetables like leafy greens and then the other one is to kind of increase exercise, but I know how challenging that may be right now given work, how stressful work has been and it’s hard to make time for that.  And then the other option or in addition to may be the other two options that I have given you is just kind of to change your medication, but I would love to get kind of stablest of labs on you before we start or change any of your medications, just to make sure we don’t have any side effects at all to the medication, does that make any sense to you?"
"91","  Yeah, yeah.  I would love to run some labs.  They are quick and easy.  They are not too painful.  Just a good blood ____ and maybe a urine test.  Right?  How do you feel right now?  Do you feel like there is anything I can do to kind of help you through your higher blood sugars and also kind of the fatigue and leg weakness?"
"92","  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that’s the plan.  That’s the hope with the lab work and also, I do not know, just kind of see where you are at and then we can kind of work from there, since it has been a while since you have even been in."
"93","  Do you have any questions or concerns?"
"94","  Hmmm, definitely.  And you are not drinking any regular soda, right, just diet soda?"
"95","  Okay, all right.  And then let me see here.  I guess counting carbs will be difficult.  Do you have any ideas for what you could do to kind of lower your sugar levels?"
"96","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, any other concerns you have today?"
"97","  No, okay.  And in the meantime, are you, can you still check your blood sugar pretty regularly for me, kind of once in the morning and then once at night?"
"98","  Do you have any troubles with getting supplies by any chance?"
"99","  Okay.  And then do you have a day that you are kind of more available to kind of come in and get the lab work and may be also get a physical exam?"
"100","  Okay.  Do you have a certain timeframe that works best for you?"
"101","  Morning?  Okay and earlier in the week.  Okay.  Okay, great.  So, I think the plan moving forward is to kind of get you in and get some lab work and then see how your lab work is doing and also kind of wait ____ and see what we can do.  Could you, yeah if it’s possible could you may be talk to your wife about may be managing or adjusting your diet if that’s possible or just give it a thought."
"102","  I know it is really."
"103","  Yeah, yeah, I know.  It is very difficult, but I think may be controlling your diet would be best and then exercise especially if you want avoid medications.  But if not, we can kind of walk through that together as we just kind of get the lab work back and then come up with a plan that works for everyone."
"104","  Okay, great and so I will get someone to set up an appointment with you and followup with you if that’s okay."
"105","  Okay and then do you have any other concerns or questions today?  Was there anything I said that was very confusing or?"
"106","  Okay, great.  And so, I’ll get you scheduled and then I will see you in person okay for a physical?"
"107","  Okay, awesome.  Thank you so much Freddie."
"108","  All right.  Give me one second here.  Okay, Kathryn?"
