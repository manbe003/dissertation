"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Mr. Johnson?"
"3","  Alright Tom.  How are you doing today?"
"4","  I did review your chart but I just want to ask you in your own words, what brings you in today?"
"5","  What was your partner worried about?"
"6","  Okay, and how long have you had the cough?"
"7","  Are you producing any sputum or would you classify it as a dry cough?"
"8","  Okay.  It might seem like a silly question but the stuff you cough up have any color or smell?"
"9","  Okay, alright.  Can you tell me a little more about anything else you might have been experiencing lately along with the cough?"
"10","  Alright.  Have you checked your temperature at all or just kind of feel warm to the touch."
"11","  How long has that been going on for?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Well, I am glad that you are here.  I think it is important that you get things checked out when you or a loved one is concerned.  So, I am glad that you are here today.  So we can visit more about it.  Have you noticed any loss of tase or smell?"
"14","  Any difficulty breathing?"
"15","  Okay.  Any fatigue or more tired than normal?"
"16","  Okay.  Can you remind me, do you deal with any chronic health conditions on a regular basis? Some people have high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?"
"17","  Do you take any medications on a daily basis?"
"18","  Okay.  Have you had the coronavirus or COVID in the past?"
"19","  Okay.  Have you received the vaccine?"
"20","  Okay.  Have you been in contact with anyone who has had COVID?"
"21","  Okay, not that you know of."
"22","  Okay.  Any recent travel?"
"23","  Okay.  What you do for work?"
"24","  Alright.  How about any recent illnesses?"
"25","  Okay.  I just review this with all patients.  Any alcohol use?"
"26","  Okay.  How many would you think that you have a day?"
"27","  Okay.  How about tobacco, smoking or chewing?"
"28","  Okay, alright.  Just a recap here.  It sounds like you have been having a cough that is kind of producing a little clear sputum for the past week.  You have also felt warm and felt more tired and your partner wanted you to come in and potentially get the COVID test.  Am I right here?"
"29","  Has she had any recent illness or she is just concerned about you?"
"30","  Okay.  What else do you think that I should know?"
"31","  Okay.  Oh, I forgot to ask you any tobacco use in the past, when you were younger did you smoke or chew?"
"32","  Okay.  The reason I ask is that sometimes COVID can have different effects on people based on their medical conditions or past experiences.  Does that make sense?"
"33","  Okay.  What questions do you have for me right now?"
"34","  Okay.  I hear you but I am glad that you are getting seen just for a checkup.  Would you remind me when your last checkup was, just kind of general checkup?"
"35","  Okay, alright but as you said you have been feeling pretty good.  You feel like you are fit as a fiddle."
"36","  Okay.  Well, at this point, based on what you have told me you are having a couple of things that make me think that it would be worth our time to get the COVID test just to make sure the cough, feeling a little warm and little tiredness.  You may not have it but if you do, it would be better to know so that we can make sure that you are not in contact with extra people and make sure that we are doing our part just to kind of having less people expose to COVID as possible.  Does that make sense?"
"37","  Okay.  So we are going to schedule a time for you to come in and they will do what we call a nasal swab.  So, they will actually stick it up your nose, it is little uncomfortable.  I know.  A lot of people, it is not their favorite but I do think it is important that you get this done.  Do you think you can do that?"
"38","  Okay, great.  I appreciate that and I think your idea about getting the vaccine in the future you know considering it, I think that is very important as well and why donâ€™t we wait to see if you currently have it or not before we make the decision to get you vaccinated.  There is some recommendation that say we wait just a little bit of time if someone actively has COVID before they get the vaccine.  Does that make sense? "
"39","  Okay.  What questions you have from me after I kind of explain what I am thinking?"
"40","  Alright.  It sounds good.  It was nice to see you today, Tom.  "
