"1","  Hi, Mr. Jones."
"2","  Freddie, how do you do.  It is nice to meet you.  My name is Lee.  I am here to do your visit today."
"3","  I hear that we are, are planning to do a diabetes checkup and you wanted to talk about some difficulty standing, is that right?"
"4","  Okay, tell me what has been going on?  What is, what is going on with this difficulty standing?"
"5","  Okay, when did you first notice this problem with standing?"
"6","  Okay.  Do you get, do you, do you have pain when you stand or is it just weakness?"
"7","  Yeah, okay.  And fill me inâ€¦.in this strange time.  What are you doing for work these days?"
"8","  Excellent, okay."
"9","  Okay, all right.  Well, they are keeping you busy.  It sounds like you have some time seated during the day, but you are also moving around?"
"10","  Okay, all right.  So I can imagine this is affecting your work.  Is that right?"
"11","  Okay.  Yeah, I am sorry to hear that.  Well, let's talk about your diabetes a little bit and see if we can circle back to your, your leg weakness.  Your weakness while standing."
"12","  Have you been taking your diabetes medications as prescribed?"
"13","  Excellent Freddie.  Hmm, and I have got you on record still taking metformin and glipizide.  Is that right?"
"14","  Okay.  And where have your sugars been lately?"
"15","  Okay.  And any, any headaches lately?"
"16","  Okay.  Any troubles with your vision?"
"17","  Good.  Do you feel any changes in your fingers or your toes? Like, it is harder to know where your pencil is or you trip on your feet?"
"18","  Great.  Those are some of the longer term problems with, with diabetes when it is uncontrolled and so I would just like to check in with my patients about those things."
"19","  Okay, all right.  Um, and you know, coming up on your age, I like to ask people to if they have ever smoked in their lifetime.  There is a screening test we do for anyone who has ever smoked."
"20","  Okay, all right.  Well, in a couple of years, we might consider doing a test just to make sure that you do not have a problem called an aortic aneurysm."
"21","  So that, that is coming up in about five years; but it sounds like you are not a smoker now, right?"
"22","  Excellent.  Well, keep up the good work.  You have made a healthy decision.  All right.  Well, the last blood sugar test we had from you is an A1c, and that A1c test, it does look like it has been rising over the last couple of years.  So, I would like to repeat that again today and I know we are all being cautious during COVID to, to not go out as much, putting on a mask and, and getting that lab test done is pretty low risk and we should be able to get, get you a vaccine soon too.  So, would you be interested in getting a COVID vaccine?"
"23","  Excellent, all right.  We will have our clinic coordinators reach out to you about how to schedule that as well.  Okay, well, coming back to this, this leg pain, leg issue, I guess I want to explore a little bit more.  Any, any kind of changes to your sensation, if you like any, does it feel strange to rub your, your skin in different parts of your body or like one side feels different than the other?"
"24","  Okay.  And do you find that you are more comfortable in any position?"
"25","  Okay, okay.  So, it is not like more comfortable to sit or to lean forward or?"
"26","  Okay, good.  I am glad to hear that there has been no pain.  But I, you know, I am starting to wonder that this might be something worth seeing you in person for just because we would be able to do a physical exam instead."
"27","  Would you be open to coming into clinic to discuss this weakness and do a physical exam with me?"
"28","  Okay, great.  So, we will schedule that after this meeting as well.  I will get you on the phone with our receptionist.  Okay, great.  Thank you so much Freddie, it is really great to meet you and I will see you as soon as we get you scheduled in clinic, okay?"
"29","  Thank you so much, all right.  Have a great rest of your day."
"30","  Bye now."
