"1","  Hello hi Mr. Jones."
"2","  Hi, nice to meet you.  My name is Melissa, I am a fourth-year medical student, I am working with your doctor and so what I want to do is kind of get an overview of what's been going on, after that I am going to go back to my, the attending and then we're going to both come back in and discuss the plan, does that sound good to you?"
"3","  Perfect, perfect. So first of all, Mr. Jones what would you like me to call you?"
"4","  Freddie, perfect awesome, Freddie how are you doing?"
"5","  Yeah.  What's been going on? So I see that you are here for a diabetes visit as well as kind of increased fatigue over the past six months and you are having trouble standing over two hours."
"6","  Yeah, yeah can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"7","  So, you noticed that you are peeing a little a lot more, how much more are you peeing now, like per day?"
"8","  Okay.  Okay and do you usually prick just to check your blood sugar every morning or do you…"
"9","  Yeah, what have those levels been?"
"10","  Okay.  Okay, okay, okay and have you still been taking the metformin and glipizide?"
"11","  Okay, do you take it regularly?"
"12","  Okay, yeah, that's totally understandable like.  So if you say like if you take – how often do you take it everyday, like do you miss maybe like one day, once a week or."
"13","  Okay, okay and has any of your diet changed or you know increase in any kind of more carby stuff or sugars?"
"14","  Okay, okay and do you kind of watch what you are eating mostly for just to make sure?"
"15","  Okay."
"16","  That totally makes sense, you can't go away from good food, that's one thing.  So I also noticed that your A1c today has kind, it has been kind of trending upward and it has been kind of going up and so that's something that we have to look into as to why it’s going up and all your symptoms kind of feeling tired, that you are you know peeing very often that's kind of also those symptoms are related to kind of just your diabetes and how to control it so that's something that we need to work on in terms of looking into what we can do in terms of should we add another possible like you know oral agent like for your diabetes so adding another one.  At this point, your A1c is not high enough to be considering you know like insulin so like the injections but…"
"17","  Yeah, we want to make sure that you don’t kind of go up to the point where we need to use insulin because that's kind of the way.  At this time, you know we can still you know do lot of diet modification, we can add a possible another agent, but I kind of want to do some labs and I am going to definitely talk to my attending about you know what kind of labs we want you to get.  We might want to do a urine sample just to see the protein and the sugars that you are peeing out and so we want to do some labs before we kind of come up with the plan."
"18","  It is very important that you do take the medication you know pretty regularly.  I know like maybe missing one is not, not, not terrible at all, but we do want to make sure that you know you take the medication because that will definitely help you control the blood sugar levels.  And in terms of the trouble standing tell me a little bit more about that?"
"19","  Yeah, okay, your legs.  How do they feel, do they feel painful or does it just give out?"
"20","  Okay, okay.  Have you fallen?"
"21","  Okay.  And when did this all start?"
"22","  Okay, last month, okay, okay.  Has there been anything like you've done extra, any extra exercises or anything that you noticed that might have caused it?"
"23","  Okay.  Any pain associated with it."
"24","  Okay, okay, okay and any rashes anywhere below, swelling?"
"25","  Okay, okay, okay, we'll definitely look into that as well.  Other things you know sometimes that diabetes may kind of show itself as you know blurry vision, you know increase in frequency in terms of urinating kind of any of that sort like getting blurry vision or numbness, tingling in the hands and feet?"
"26","  Yeah, yeah okay, okay, okay, yeah.  And that we definitely want to get kind of a possibly another blood sugar level just to make sure because we want to make sure that you know – and you are staying hydrated with all the peeing?"
"27","  Okay, okay, yeah.  And any dizziness, lightheadedness, any fainting or any of that sort?"
"28","  Okay, other things, any shortness of breath, chest pain any of that?"
"29","  Okay, okay, any rashes that you noticed anywhere or any easy bruising?"
"30","  Okay, okay. Alright, well I will talk to the doctor and we're going to both come in and come up with a plan, but it sounds like you know your A1c level is kind of slowly trending up and it seems like the medication that we have given to you right now aren't working as well as we hope so we kind of want to either modify a little bit of diet and then maybe modify a little bit of your medication hopefully to make sure you know all of the symptoms that you are experiencing the fatigue, the constantly going to the bathroom, the thirst all of that kind of associated to the diabetes is well managed okay?"
"31","  So we also want to do some labs.  How do you feel about that?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  Do you have any concerns or anything that you want to – other things that you want to discuss?"
"33","  Yeah, yeah, we want to make sure that you continue eating your wife's good cooking."
"34","  Awesome, okay well I will go back and talk to the doctor and I'll come back in okay?"
"35","  Okay.  Thank you.  I think we'll just end the chat session."
"36","  Thank you so much Freddie."
