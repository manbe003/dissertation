"1","  Okay, can you hear me now?"
"2","  Oh, good."
"3","  I am doing pretty good today.  Just wanting to check in with you, I haven’t been in about a year or so, just want to check on my health."
"4","  Okay, mm-hmm thank you."
"5","  No, about a few years ago, I was diagnosed with diabetes and so I haven’t been in like I said in about a year and so I just want to kind of check in and make sure everything is going well."
"6","  It’s relatively good that I, you know, take medication and so but just recently I have been more so concerned with being tired, just exhausted at the end of the day and I have, you know, urination has occurred more frequently."
"7","  Yes, it just seems like at the end of the day just there is no energy left, and so I have three grandkids and I want to kind of keep up with and enjoy and so when I get home, they want to play with me and interact with me and I am just ___ and just so and that was a real concern right now."
"8","  Eight, five and two."
"9","  You know lots of energy, I wish I could capture about 10% of it and that’ll be more better."
"10","  I am a program coordinator for Retirement Home in Seattle."
"11","  Yes, I take 500 mg of metformin."
"12","  And also take glipizide, okay twice a day."
"13","  No, I take it twice a day, I do not take it in the morning and around just before dinner."
"14","  One pill each, okay, a one in the morning and one in the evening."
"15","  Okay."
"16","  No, I average between six and seven hours at night and that’s my average, sometimes a little more maybe an hour, sometimes a little less depends on just your body you know you never know how long you’re going to sleep you know."
"17","  No, no.  I can blink three times and I am gone."
"18","  Generally, it happens at the end of the day between leaving, working and getting home, it just that space then I could be you know the energy expanded during the course of the day but by the time I get home and I am this way, I am just exhausted."
"19","  I would say, yes, I mean our bodies are always changing, but on average I would say yes."
"20","  Probably the last three or four months that I have really noticed that I am going a lot more frequently than I have in the past you know, some days are better than others but it has increased I would say at least 10 to 15%."
"21","  No."
"22","  Uh, that’s questionable, yes I would say because it’s been going on for couple of months here I know that when I start feeling the symptoms, I need to go and so I make the time to go so that I won’t have an accident on the way to the bathroom, okay, yeah."
"23","  No, no."
"24","  No, not really, it seems to be about the same and after maybe the third or fourth time, it’s pretty clear you know."
"25","  I would say maybe a little above average, I do try to because I know I am urinating more, I tried to drink more water and that just complicates, I happen to go more frequently.  So, it’s like chasing a bear, right."
"26","  Sure, sure."
"27","  No, no."
"28","  No, I haven’t."
"29","  Not that I would recall, right you know my job requires that I do a lot of sitting.  So, you know I don’t do more standing, I do more sitting just because of the work that I do."
"30","  My mother had diabetes and she is in her 80s and my father didn’t have problems, he died a few years ago."
"31","  No problem."
"32","  With them?"
"33","  I am not aware of that type of situation with them, I just know that she has diabetes and you know she is in her 80s.  So, she is managing it somehow you know."
"34","  In the morning, I’ll have you know at breakfast, eggs and coffee with cream and sugar and hash browns and at lunch, I will get a cheeseburger and hash browns and large soda and then generally in the evening my wife cooks dinner.  So, you know she has steak and potatoes and after dinner I’ll have maybe a bowl of ice cream after that and on the weekend, she likes cooking fried chicken and I like eating fried chicken.  So, that’s generally my diet, my normal diet, okay."
"35","  My preference is chocolate."
"36","  No, just rarely you know maybe if there is some you know food in the office there and pass by any new lunch home, I may, you know stop by and pick up maybe cooking or something, but that’s not on a daily basis."
"37","  Soda is a soda but normally it’s you know, it’s just a regular soda, it’s not you know not a diet soda."
"38","  No, I haven’t like I say I haven’t been in, in a year and in the past I was you know trying to be fairly regular coming in every four to six months to check on it but just regular schedule now the things going on and so I just want to check in with you to see if everything is going okay and if there is anything that I can do to manage my diabetes more."
"39","  Yes, two a day, twice a day, yeah."
"40","  I have tried Splenda in the past and the impact on my bladder was not positive, I mean it seems like it caused me to go to urinate more frequently and so I just went back to what was tasting good and what was working for me at the time, but is that what you’re recommending or suggesting."
"41","  I did try diet one time and it seemed to have the same impact as you know you just diet was just as bad as the regular you know it just caused me too frequent to urinate more and those.  So, I just went back why in the aftertaste of the diet did necessarily agree with me.  So, I went back to regular path, soda."
"42","  Sure."
"43","  That’s a start.  I could give that a try and monitor that."
"44","  Okay."
"45","  I rarely eat fruits and vegetables.  My wife you know she generally does dinner and et cetera and then I doing prep in the middle of the day for lunch which is quick and easy and fast for me because I have to kind of get back to the office.  So, that is just not been an integral part of my diet lately."
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Sure, sure."
"48","  Sure."
"49","  I can try that because now currently I put two scoops of chocolate ice cream into a bowl and that’s just absolutely delicious.  By cutting back and maybe having one, okay that could be satisfying, I would be willing to give that a try."
"50","  I have since my last visit a year ago, I have started walking twice a week squeezing that in and but that’s pretty much the most improved change I made is just trying to get more exercise in and it’s just a busy schedule and like I say when I get in, in the evening and the kids are running around and that’s exercise but not the type of exercise probably invigorate my whole body, so but yes, that said, pretty much ___."
"51","  Well, I would definitely discuss that with her you know our schedule is such that she watches the kids during the day.  So, when I get in, they transfer their energy from her to me and then she is preparing dinner and you know so we are just ___ for time really, but what I could definitely discuss that with her as long as well as the other suggestions and recommendations you have in terms of incorporating more vegetables and things in the dinner.  I hope I don’t get too mush push back from her."
"52","  Okay."
"53","  Right."
"54","  Yes."
"55","  Okay."
"56","  Okay, okay."
"57","  Okay."
"58","  Okay."
"59","  Okay."
"60","  Okay, sure."
"61","  Okay."
"62","  No, not at this present time.  I know at the facility that I work at, they have been encouraging us to get the vaccines, it’s just that I just haven’t gotten around to it but it was definitely something that I would definitely to consider, you know take into consideration my age and the people that I am working out, so yes."
"63","  No, no."
"64","  No, no."
"65","  That sounds like a winner, we could do that."
"66","  Okay."
"67","  Yes, but you know recently when I checked it was like 130/80 and that was a year ago and so you know I am not currently aware, I don’t feel any different in terms of you can’t hardly tell whether you have, you know pressure you know as far as I can tell, but that again a year ago it was 130/80."
"68","  Sure, sure, okay.  Could you give me the name of the medication?"
"69","  Okay, and the other one?"
"70","  Okay."
"71","  Okay and this is for high blood pressure, right."
"72","  Okay, okay."
"73","  Okay."
"74","  Okay, can you hold for just a second, I have to run to the restroom?"
"75","  Okay, okay.  Sorry about that."
"76","  Okay."
"77","  That was a lot yeah."
"78","  I still have two scoops of ice cream, maybe just one a smaller portion."
"79","  Adding more vegetables to the diet in especially in the evening you know."
"80","  Just enjoying that and just watching the foods that I eat.  The fried chicken instead of having it you know every weekend maybe every other weekend and maybe once in a month or something like that to reduce you know that fat intake and soda into my system.  So, that sounds like a plan but my wife does you know all of the cooking.  So, I would definitely want to have her included in on this plan.  So, you’ve indicated that you would provide me with a short list that I can discuss with her and then we can take it from there."
"81","  Yes."
"82","  Okay."
"83"," Two twice a day, so that’s totally four."
"84","  I am trying to increase the exercise more than twice a week and then trying to do at least 20 to 30 minutes a day each day."
"85","  Okay."
"86","  Sure, sure, okay."
"87","  You’re going to be checking my kidneys and my blood count and et cetera I mean you had a long, long list and I didn’t write them down so and I have you know kind of follow like a list or email in something and specifically addresses those recommendations that you have."
"88","  Okay, okay."
"89","  That we should consider getting a vaccine and especially because of number of factors, my age, where I work, family members and et cetera, and it should be a higher priority on my list now."
"90","  Just getting old and I don’t want to die right now.  So, that’s why we’re here but I appreciate your comments and your input and suggestions in regards to making some changes and it’s going to take time you know and just changing habits and routines that we have and so it’s definitely been helpful?"
"91","  Okay, okay."
"92","  Okay."
"93","  Okay."
"94","  Sure, okay."
"95","  Yes, it’s beautiful, okay.  Thank you so much, I really appreciate it."
"96","  Okay."
