"1","  Here we go, I got it."
"2","  Wait a minute, now where did they go, uh."
"3","  Yeah, this damn, I am sorry, it is just the mouse thing you have to use, there is no mouse, you just got to move it around and then it always goes somewhere wrong anyway."
"4","  Well I just, I basically figure I got a cold that's all that it is, but my girlfriend made me set this up to see if it is cold or COVID and she is complaining because I haven’t been to the doctor for 10 years or more and so she wants you to give me a checkup, do a general checkup."
"5","  Excuse me, a general checkup.  Just want to see if I have a cold or if I have COVID."
"6","  Okay."
"7","  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, yeah, sure."
"8","  Most of this week I guess since about Monday or Tuesday."
"9","  Yeah, yeah, I have got a stuffed up nose and a bit of a cough and it is very itchy throat."
"10","  Itchy eye too I guess.  Kind of hot, it's not real hot but pretty hot.  That's about it."
"11","  Yeah, okay."
"12","  Well, I would like to but my ex has my thermometer and all bunch of stuff that I shouldn’t have left behind, anyway I figure it is probably about a 99 or something like that, you know."
"13","  I take DayQuil and NyQuil and I guess it helps something, helps somewhat."
"14","  Okay, I guess I am just kind of extra tired."
"15","  Maybe yeah."
"16","  Yes, I have had cold before as though it kind of seems like that.  My girlfriend is worried about COVID so she is the one who wants to make me get a test and do all that stuff, so I guess I got to do that."
"17","  Not that I know of, they haven't told me."
"18","  No, Debbie did, but I didn’t, I mean my girlfriend did but I am just kind of waiting to see how it works out, you know."
"19","  No I read a lot of stuff online about it, so I am not really sure but well we'll see how it goes."
"20","  Okay, yeah."
"21","  I guess so I don’t why she is worried but anyway, yeah."
"22","  I work hard, I work in construction and so it is physical work and I like that, I like riding bikes, bicycles so Debbie and I both like to ride."
"23","  Yeah, anyway what was the question?"
"24","  No."
"25","  I don’t take meds much."
"26","  None of those things I guess.  My grandpa died when I was young so I guess he just had colon cancer or something like that I guess."
"27","  Let's see, my mom beat breast cancer yeah, but then she died a couple of years ago, she was what, 75."
"28","  I think it was natural causes, I don’t know."
"29","  Well, I thought I was getting primary care here, you are just secondary care or what's the thing here?  I think it is kind of confusing, you know."
"30","  Well I guess so I mean I don’t have to go to the doctor very often, all I have to do is deal with my current situation, and then so I am not sure how many doctor visits you have to have I mean."
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Well maybe after we make sure that I don’t have COVID right now because basically I just want to make my girlfriend happy and do what she says so, we can do those other stuff some day, but right now I just, I would rather just get something for my cold if the DayQuil is not enough to work for that and find out if I've got COVID or whatever."
"33","  Yes, how do I get this COVID test, what do I have to do, can I buy them at the drug store or what?"
"34","  Yeah, I've seen those pictures."
"35","  Okay, I guess so."
"36","  All right."
"37","  Yeah, great.  What do I do now?"
"38","  Okay great."
"39","  Okay, thank you."
"40","  Oh, let’s see.  Oh, I get it, there is, yeah."
