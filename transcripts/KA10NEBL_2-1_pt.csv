"1","  Hi."
"2","  Well, I’m pretty good, pretty good."
"3","  My pleasure, my pleasure.  Thank you."
"4","  Yeah, I've been worried about my diabetes lately.  It's been about a year since I have been to a doctor because my other doctor just kind of annoyed me, and that’s why I’m looking for a new one, but I guess what I’m worried about is why I get so tired now, yeah."
"5","  Yeah, that’s about it, that’s about it, that’s what I’ve kind of noticed it."
"6","  Not that I have seen, that’s just the thing that I believe has particularly bothered me."
"7","  I don’t know, I think when it started I thought I just wasn’t getting enough sleep but I have been clocking them and I’m getting between seven and eight hours at night.  It’s just that well my wife started watching our grandchildren, they are three of them you know."
"8","  Yeah, they’re lovely kids but I just, you know, I like playing with them, being with them and I just noticed that I was just so tired all the time you know it could be the little one.  Well, you got to keep on top with the little one, he is two and he is just, he is just quicker than an NBA guard, you know the athlete guy."
"9","  Oh yeah, he is just, he is just like if you ever leave a box around, he just would want to know, wants to know what’s in there."
"10","  For the last pretty much a year or so I guess."
"11","  So, my daughter started working again.  So, we’re watching until they you know, get home."
"12","  Well I feel lucky myself, you’ve got to keep, being around young people, it kind of keeps you young."
"13","  Yeah, I’ve just kind of, it’s been a year, as I said it’s been a year since I checked my diabetes and I think I have come up, it seems to be climbing into the yellow a lot."
"14","  Well, that’s the green part is everything is cool, yellow is it’s getting kind of high, the sugars getting kind of high."
"15","  Yeah, today it was 215."
"16","  Generally around 200 or you know a little around there."
"17","  Usually about twice a week first thing in the morning before breakfast."
"18","  I haven’t because I had my blood pressure checked a year ago."
"19","  And it was good."
"20","  Yeah, yeah, I do that twice a day?"
"21","  Yeah, yeah, twice a day too."
"22","  No, they seem to be fine, they work, they seem to be working fine for me."
"23","  I see."
"24","  That’s what I heard, I’ve heard little bit above 8 then they start talking about insulin."
"25","  I want to avoid that."
"26","  Well, I had, the first doctor I talked to, I asked when I was diagnosed eight years ago.  I came in when I had this tingling in my legs."
"27","  And I asked the doctor about that and he says well you know we can put you on these drugs and then he mentioned insulin and I was like oh, I don’t need that."
"28","  No, no."
"29","  Good, that’s good.  So, that’s what I wanted to hear."
"30","  Yeah, yeah fine "
"31","  No, no. all right, it’s fine."
"32","  And I shouldn’t expect any unusual side effects with that."
"33","  Yeah, yeah."
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Aspirin, yeah, that’s just regular, that’s just like with Bayer right?"
"36","  Okay."
"37","  Yeah, I see."
"38","  With the statin and that’s for cholesterol right?"
"39","  Okay, yeah, that sounds sensible."
"40","  Oh, okay, yeah."
"41","  I think I asked them all that I can think of."
"42","  Yeah, I don’t know how, when that came up because I do a desk job normally.  I am a homecare coordinator at Norfolk Home.  So, I have to get up and move around for a while but I’ve started to notice that it was just sort of it was just hard to stand up after sitting down for a while."
"43","  I noticed it again about little maybe like couple, three months ago."
"44","  It didn’t really come up because I’ve been it’s normally when just standing because you know I can, I have been doing just kind of like walks and getting exercise, I talked about that, take walks with my wife a couple of times a week."
"45","  About a mile."
"46","  I’m guessing ___ at the library."
"47","  Well, my legs start to hurt, my back, my lower back and that feels, walking I guess."
"48","  Yeah, yeah."
"49","  No it's really just standing."
"50","  No, I haven’t."
"51","  Well, they just said it was a nerve thing that’s sometime."
"52","  Diabetes you know nerve thing."
"53","  No, no."
"54","  It’s just from I guess, it’s just from just lower back I guess sometimes when I am sitting.  If I am walking around, it’s okay but when I am just."
"55","  Standing around, I had to kind of move around a little bit otherwise they gets stiff."
"56","  No, not, no. I remember I get my stomach upset, I had some ibuprofen but I don’t like to do that."
"57","  I don’t recall."
"58","  Yeah, it really just doesn’t happen enough."
"59","  Yeah, almost immediately."
"60","  It just feels stressed I guess.  So, it’s not sharp, it just sort of gets achy."
"61","  It just feels sort of stressed and it’s just mostly annoying than anything else."
"62","  Lot of the back, back of my leg."
"63","  No, it s mostly kind of yeah behind the knee a little bit up through like the yeah behind the knee, maybe a little bit through at the back of my thigh or something?"
"64","  No, I haven’t noticed that."
"65","  Yeah, I just feel stressed I guess I feel like it is stressed you know."
"66","  It’s not like sharp pain or anything like that just kind of vaguely achy."
