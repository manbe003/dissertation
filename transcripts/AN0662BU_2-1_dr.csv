"1","  Yes, I think so."
"2","  Hello."
"3","  I do not think, I do not think so."
"4","  Hi.  I know you are just, you are all settled?"
"5","  Yes, yes it is.  Well, my name is Jordan.  I am a third year medical student and I understand you are Freddie, correct?"
"6","  Yes, very good.  Do you prefer to be called Freddie?"
"7","  Okay, excellent.  So you know obviously this is over telemedicine and so I can hear you just fine.  Can you hear me just fine?"
"8","  Okay, excellent.  And it is not the traditional doctor's visit, but the purpose of today is really sit down and have a conversation, and I understand this appointment is about your diabetic care.  Is that correct?"
"9","  Yes, I am sorry about last visit.  It was a little bit surprising or frustrating for you and I - the questions that I have for you about you know how your diabetes is doing and then at the end I am happy to answer any questions that you have to maybe you know make this visit not frustrating or alleviate any concerns you have.  Okay?"
"10","  Okay.  So these are probably very similar to the questions that you have gotten in the past.  Do you check your blood sugars?"
"11","  Okay and what numbers do you typically get when you take your blood sugar?"
"12","  Okay.  And is that a blood sugar that you take after meals or right in the morning?"
"13","  Okay, good.  Thank you, that is helpful.  Okay.  And then I currently see that you are on metformin and glipizide, is that correct?"
"14","  Okay and you take both of those medications as prescribed?"
"15","  Okay, good.  And what you cannot see over here is that I am just taking some notes, okay?"
"16","  All right.  Do you have any issues getting diabetic supplies?"
"17","  Okay.  And I am happy to refill your medications as part of this as well, okay?  Do you have enough medications?"
"18","  Okay.  And then when you say usually, do you ever miss a dose?"
"19","  Okay.  Okay.  That is good.  I am glad you are not like missing a dose every day.  Okay.  You know life happens and that is okay.  Do you have any difficulty getting your medications, like going out to get them or do you have any difficulty affording your medications?"
"20","  Okay, can I help you with either of those things?"
"21","  Can I help with, you know we have a couple of programs or we like for example Wal-Mart has a discounted price on most diabetic medications, and I am happy to help coordinate with our pharmacist if that is something that you would be interested in or I can see with our pharmacist if you are somebody that has a mail order option so you do not have to go out and get your medications.  Are you interested in either of those?"
"22","  Yes, those are great questions for our pharmacist.  So I as - when we are done with this visit I will put a message in to her.  Okay?"
"23","  Yes.  And you know, coordination refills and what not can take a little while.  But if you have not heard in about a week, go ahead and give our office a call back, okay?"
"24","  Anyway, as part of diabetes we are supposed to look at our feet once a day.  Do you look at the bottom of your feet every day?"
"25","  Yes, okay.  Would you say you do it every couple of days?"
"26","  Okay, yes.  You know, and as part of diabetes, you just do not quite have the feeling in your feet that you once did and so we just worry about people you know getting wounds or sores that they do not notice and we do not want to have something become a bigger problem."
"27","  Okay.  And then have you been to the eye doctor within the last year?"
"28","  Okay.  And is that because of the pandemic or just having a hard time getting in?"
"29","  Yes, okay.  You know, one thing that I can do is that, you know how typically when you go to the doctors sometimes you are given a printout of what happened in that visit.  We can provide you with that and on it will be a little reminder to schedule with your eye doctor. Okay?  Now that things are starting to open up back up again just as to help you remember to get in this year for your diabetic eye exam.  Okay?"
"30","  Do you have someone you see for your eyes already?"
"31","  Okay, would you like a new referral?"
"32","  Yes, okay.  I can get the referral at the pharmacy and the referral to an optometrist, okay?  One for you…All right, I will ask couple of questions.  Do you get regular exercise?"
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Yes.  All right and when you do get out, how far or how long do you typically go for?"
"35","  Okay.  Okay.  And then tell me a little bit about your diet.  Have you been eating up fried chicken?"
"36","  Yes, yes.  And I think, you know, obviously we know the fried chicken is not the healthiest of options.  We also know that you have to have a life in some balance and…"
"37","  Yes, yes."
"38","  Yes, okay good.  You kind of seem to understand that like it is totally fine to have fried chicken.  You just have to do it in moderation.  Okay?  And one thing that I always offer to patients is a couple of things.  Your wife is always welcome to join us on these visits, especially because you know part of controlling your blood sugar is what you eat.  So I always…"
"39","  Yes, that is okay.  I just always offer because couples obviously share food and one thing I always offer is that nutrition counseling for diabetic patients.  Is that something that you are interested in?"
"40","  Would you like a little bit more information in terms of what they typically do with patients, would that be helpful?"
"41","  The nutritionist."
"42","  Kind of their role in your diabetes care, you can always say no to their…"
"43","  Yes, so…"
"44","  Yes, I can totally give you a little bit more information.  I can include that, we can with the couple of other things that we talked about.  Okay.  You know I think that those are all the questions that I needed to ask.  Do you have any questions for me or things that you feel like I should know about your diabetes care or your health in general?"
"45","  Yes, and I think I saw kind of in your appointment note that you are - it is not only the fatigue, but you are kind of having trouble standing for more than a couple of hours?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  And when do you start feeling a little bit more fatigued, how long has this been going on?"
"48","  Okay."
"49","  Okay.  Did it seem to be triggered by any event in particular or just kind of you slowly started noticing you are getting more and more tired?"
"50","  Okay."
"51","  Of course, okay.  So to delve into that a little bit more, lots of things can play a role in fatigue.  Have you had any changes to your eating habits? I do not think so based on what we talked about earlier.  Okay."
"52","  Okay.  Any major life events?"
"53","  Okay.  Have you noticed any weight loss?"
"54","  Okay.  How about any fevers?"
"55","  Okay, chills?"
"56","  Okay.  Do you feel like you are getting enough sleep at night?"
"57","  Okay.  What time do you typically go to bed at night?"
"58","  And what time do you typically wake up?"
"59","  Yes, okay.  And then other than waking up to go to the bathroom a lot in the night, are you tossing and turning at night or do you sleep pretty soundly in between?"
"60","  Okay.  Does Louise notice that you snore?"
"61","  Okay.  And do you take naps at all?"
"62","  Okay.  Are you doing okay right now?"
"63","  Okay.  And you know let us say it is Saturday and you are not at work that day and you are just watching TV on the couch, will you fall asleep to that?"
"64","  It sounds like you are a sports fan is what I have gathered."
"65","  This is true.  This is very true, okay.  Have you ever been evaluated for sleep apnea in the past?"
"66","  Okay.  I have a few more questions about getting up to pee in the middle of the night.  Has that changed in frequency recently?"
"67","  Okay.  Do you feel like it affects your sleep quality getting up that much?"
"68","  Yes.  Is that something where you wake up sometimes and you are incontinent like the sheets are wet?"
"69","  Never?  Okay.  All right.  So we talked about diabetes here, we talked about fatigue.  Are there other concerns that you have about your health?"
"70","  Yes, absolutely.  We are definitely all on the same page there.  You know, I think in terms of ___ thinking about, of course I have go out and talk to my supervising physician, but you know typically, we will probably have you come in for some lab work related to the diabetes.  There are a couple of other studies that are just related to your fatigue that can give me a little bit more information.  Okay?  And then you know, I think you know sleep can be tricky.  There are a couple of things I have in my mind, but I do think it might be worthwhile for you to come in for an in-person evaluation just so that we can do a physical exam.  Okay?  Do you have any questions or does that sound about all right to you?  Of course, you know, we will come back in together, so you will have a few more minutes to think of your questions, but any initial thoughts or things that you have thought of?"
"71","  Okay.  All right.  I am going to go ahead and step out and talk to my supervising physician and then we will both get back in together, okay?"
"72","  Yes, yes.  So we will both be here on that screen together and thanks for sticking with the telehealth here.  I know it is definitely a different experience."
"73","  All righty.  You are welcome.  We will be back in."
