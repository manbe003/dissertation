"35","  Oh, I guess it's the feeling tired all the time, that wears you down."
"36","  No, not that I can think of."
"37","  I haven’t been to a doctor in 10 years at least, I don't know.  I haven’t talked to pretty much anybody about those things, no."

"65","  I like the outdoors."
"66","  Yeah, except on the days like today where it's pouring rain, but…"
"67","  Oh I try."
"68","  Well, my girlfriend was to take a long trip down the coast and I want to kind of be in good shape to go along with her, so feeling the way I do today, I just don't think I'd go anywhere, so I'm just trying to make her happy."

"80","  No, no.  My girlfriend hasn’t complained yet, so hope I'm on the right track."
"81","  No, I don't think so."
"82","  ______.  I think my grandpa had colon cancer when he was, I was really young when he passed away, I don't know.  I think that's what it was."
"83","  My mom beat breast cancer though."
"84","  But, well yeah, but she passed away later on from, just natural causes I guess, but…"
"85","  I don't think so."
"86","  No."
"87","  Not that I recall, no.  I've been pretty healthy.  I mean, knock on wood there."
"88","  I guess we've covered it all.  Just, I don't know, how are things looking, and what you think?"
