"1","  Yes, I do.  Hi."
"2","  Good afternoon.  How are you doing?"
"3","  Okay.  Well, let me introduce myself.  I am Candice Pollard, I am currently a fourth-year medical student about to graduate in a few days and so nice to meet you."
"4","  Oh, yeah, yeah, also very nervous."
"5","  Yeah.  So, what brought you in today and what would you like to be covered?"
"6","  Yeah, I mean it is concerning given our environment right now."
"7","  So, I am glad that you know we’re going to talk about it.  So, other than how long have you had the cough?"
"8","  Okay, alright.  I see that you don’t smoke.  Did you ever smoke?"
"9","  Okay, alright and other than cough, any fever, chill, any other you know infectious or you know like symptoms?"
"10","  Okay.  Have you taken your temperature?"
"11","  No, okay, alright but do you feel like when you put your hand on your forehead, it feels a little bit warmer than usual."
"12","  Okay, alright.  Do you feel short of breath?"
"13","  Short of breath?"
"14","  Okay, alright and are you coughing up anything?"
"15","  Okay and what color is the phlegm?"
"16","  Okay, alright.  Is it a lot, is it just a little bit?"
"17","  Alright, okay and how are you doing overall other than this cough, are you still able to eat and sleep and do your daily activities?"
"18","  Okay and have you been in contact with anybody that are known to have COVID?"
"19","  Okay.  What about recent travels?"
"20","  Okay."
"21","  Alright.  What about what kind of precaution are you taking when you go out to the community to prevent yourself from having COVID?"
"22","  Okay, alright and would you say your cough is getting better, the same or worse?"
"23","  Yeah, yeah, definitely and I don’t see any medical histories.  Do you have any past medical histories?"
"24","  Diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?"
"25","  Or lung problems, kidney problems?"
"26","  No, alright, great.  Well, you are generally very healthy."
"27","  Yeah, nice, awesome, yeah, I mean I think it will be definitely wise to get a COVID test, the PCR test, which is just test for the RNA of the virus, I think that will be you know just to assure us there is nothing to you know worry about or if we do find out it’s COVID then we will take extra precaution and you know keep an eye on you just to make sure that we are supporting you in whatever ways that we can."
"28","  And yeah and since you had it for five days, it might be also good idea to revisit us you know in a few days if the cough is still the same because I’m worry about pneumonia and things like that."
"29","  So, would you able to willing to come in to the clinic and have me examine you, listen to your lung because the Televisit, it’s very great, it’s convenient but it’s difficult for me to you know examine you."
"30","  And then also if I am concerned I might recommend you know a chest x-ray in case that I feel like there might be some suspicious you know pathology or anything going on in the lung."
"31","  You know, we don’t want to miss anything."
"32","  That needs to be treated because you know with lung disease, there is the viral one which will usually take care of yourself, you know you just have to rest, drink a lot, keep yourself hydrated, you can take some honey, it will help fuse the you know the throat and then with the bacteria infection it kind of needs the antibiotic and that usually kind of lingers, it just doesn’t go away and so that’s why I want you to come back and just revisit this."
"33","  If you’re continued to feel it, feeling it’s about the same or maybe getting worse."
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Yeah, alright but I think step one is we can definitely get the COVID test."
"36","  But then before the test result come out just make sure that you go out to the public with a mask or just stay at home and rest and drink plenty of water you know."
"37","  And what other things would you like to address today?"
"38","  Okay."
"39","  Yeah."
"40","  Yeah."
"41","  Yeah, I mean it might also be a good idea for her to get tested with you."
"42","  You know."
"43","  Okay."
"44","  Is there any other question I can answer for you?"
"45","  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good, yeah.  I would like to revisit with you maybe in five to seven days."
"46","  If your symptoms still persist or getting worse, okay and finger-crossed nothing is bad and you know and that hopefully that you get better."
"47","  Yeah."
"48","  Yeah."
"49","  Yeah."
"50","  Alright.  It was nice meeting you."
"51","  Take care, bye."
