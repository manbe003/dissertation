"1","  Hi, Mr. Johnson.  Are you able to hear me?  Mr. Johnson, are you able to hear me?"
"2","  Hi."
"3","  Hi, Mr. Johnson, I'm Nathan. I'm a fourth year medical student. How are you?"
"4","  I'm really sorry to hear you're not feeling well."
"5","  Tell me what's been going on."
"6","  Hmm."
"7","  Gotcha.  Well, I'm glad you're able to come in to, to be seen, so scratchy throat and a cough sounds like, how long have those been going on for?"
"8","  Okay.  And how's your breathing been?"
"9","  Okay.  That's good to hear.  When you cough, are you bringing anything up or is it kind of dry?"
"10","  Some stuff up, okay, okay.  And just kind of, you know compared to your baseline, how do you feel? Do you feel sick andâ€¦"
"11","  How do you feel when you don't have a cough and a scratchy throat?"
"12","  Okay.  And sounds like did your girlfriend make the appointment or it is just kind of?"
"13","  Okay.  Is there a possibility, do you think, that you could have had contact with somebody with COVID?"
"14","   Hmm."
"15","  Gotcha.  Uh, have you had your vaccination yet?  I know it's starting to be available here and there."
"16","  Okay, okay.  Gotcha.  Um, so what have you been doing to help this cough out?  To make it better.  I saw you're taking DayQuil."
"17","  Okay, okay.  Any other medications that you take on a regular basis?"
"18","  Okay.  Um.  And what medical conditions do you have?"
"19","  Is this cough?  Gotcha.  Okay.  Umm, sometimes, we would like to ask patients about lifestyle factors that can impact their cough.  Do you, I saw that you don't smoke tobacco, correct?"
"20","  Okay.  And just like to have a few beers a day, right?"
"21","  Okay, okay.  Umm. Sounds good.  And are you around folks that smoke at all?"
"22","  What do you do for work?"
"23"," Oh, fantastic.  Thanks for all that you do.  I bet you've been busy with all the construction in Seattle lately."
"24","  What's your niche within construction?"
"25","  Okay, perfect.  Do you have a favorite job that you've done so far?"
"26","  Oh man.  Yeah.  That is.  I bet that would be a little bit different than the standard apartment building or yeah."
"27","  Umm. Well, good.  Well, I guess I'm just getting kind of getting back to your cough.  Anything that you feel like I've missed from your story that umm, that you liked to me to know about, or anything you think is contributing to this cough?"
"28","  Yeah. I think that's that sounds pretty reasonable.  Umm, if you don't mind, do you mind if I ask you a few questions about just doing that kind of top to bottom?"
"29","  Okay.  So, I'm just going to ask you kind of a series of symptoms that people with a cough may be experiencing and all you need to do is say yes or no?  So, any headaches?"
"30","  Okay, how about fevers or chills?"
"31","  Warm.  Okay, I guess we did have a warm day the other day, but it's pretty cool now.  So, feeling warm is a little bit different."
"32","  What about muscle aches?  Any muscle aches?"
"33","  And you mentioned the cough.  Have you been coughing up any blood by chance? "
"34","  No blood.  Okay, okay.  Chest pain or tightness?"
"35","  Ok.  I'm glad to hear.  And what about any kind of GI upset?  So nausea?"
"36","  Gastrointestinal, sorry.  So, stomach problems or that sort of thing?"
"37","  Little diarrhea, okay.  Umm, you know, it's can be, you know, strange to talk about, but the talking about the kind of consistency of your bowel movements is important for us to know.  Did the diarrhea have any blood in it?"
"38","  Okay, Okay, that's sounds so unpleasant.  I'm sorry you had to go through that."
"39","  So, it sounds like a little diarrhea."
"40","  Oh, that's not new."
"41","  Okay, okay.  Umm, is that something that you'd like us to check out?  I know that you're here for a cough, but you know as your primary care office, we're happy to work that up too if that bothers you."
"42","  Okay, okay, fair enough."
"43","  Good.  It sure sounds like it.  And it's not exactly a good time when you're coming in to see the doctor for anybody.  Yeah.  Okay.  But just so, it just sounds like the recent changes in your health have been this this cough and maybe, maybe feeling a little bit warm.  Does that sound right?"
"44","  Okay, okay.  Um, well, do you mind if we move on to talk kind of about next steps?  Is that okay with you unless you have anything else to add?"
"45","   So, what it's sounding like to me based on, you know, the fact that you don't smoke, but this has been this, you know, recent cough that's come up, is it does sound like a respiratory virus to me.  Umm.  And so, I agree with your girlfriend, I would like to do a COVID test today, but oftentimes these sorts of things pass on their own and so what we can do is, you know, having you continue with that DayQuil, drinking plenty of water, getting a lot of rest.  I'd be happy to write you a note for the foreman on your job site to take off time from work."
"46","  Yeah."
"47","  (Laughs) I'm happy to write that for you and then importantly, you know one of the things that if the COVID test comes back positive that I've been having patients do is to get have you seen the oxygen monitors before they clip onto your pointer finger?  You can get them at Bartel's."
"48","  Yeah. And this is a little bit, you know, one step ahead if it does happen to be COVID, but umm, I'll write a prescription for you to pick one of those up from the drugstore and when you're at home, you know, just clipping it on every couple of hours or so to make sure that your oxygen saturations are staying above 90."
"49","  No, (laughs) it's not oxygen per se, but just to measure because you know sometimes, these respiratory conditions particularly with COVID can sneak up on you fast and you know I care about your health and want you to stay healthy.  Does that sound okay to you?"
"50","  Okay. . Um, but otherwise, yeah, so I'll get that work note printed off for you.  And I'm really hoping that this isn't COVID, Mr. Johnson, I'm. hoping that, you know, it's just a cold.  It'll pass and we can get you on to live in your fit life, does that sound okay to you?"
"51","  Okay.  What questions do you have about all that?  That was a lot of information at once."
"52","  Okay, sounds good.  Umm one thing that I did forget to mention, I should say is if you are having those fevers and things, one thing you can take is Tylenol."
"53","  And you can just pick that up over the counter from your drugstore, and if it's the normal strength Tylenol, you can take up to six of those over the course of a day for fever or aches and pains."
"54","  Hopefully that'll make you feel a little bit better too."
"55","  Well, it was a pleasure chatting with you, Mr. Johnson, and I really do hope that you feel better.  Feel free to give us a call if anything else comes up.  Any questions, you're feeling worse and we'll go from there, okay?"
"56","  Appreciate your time and have a great rest of your day."
"57","  Bye now."
