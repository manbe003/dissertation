"1","  Hello."
"2","  Oh.  Hi."
"3","  Ha, ha, well.  Hopefully you can tell me."
"4","  Well, maybe not.  My girlfriend wanted me to come in.  She made this appointment."
"5","  Oh, I guess it must be, I guess it must be this cough."
"6","  Excuse me.  Oh, I guess about a week or so."
"7","  Oh, there is some stuff."
"8","  I do not even know why I am here."
"9","  Stuff usually goes away."
"10","  Oh, it stayed the same."
"11","  Oh, like what?"
"12","  well, I have had a little of that well, my throat is scratching when I go to coughing, but I have felt a little warm lately."
"13","  No, but I know what I am feeling warm."
"14","  Yeah, coughing that stuff."
"15","  No, no."
"16","  Not that I know of."
"17","   She is worried about that COVID."
"18","  Not yet.  I am going to get it."
"19","  Well, yeah, I go to work every day."
"20","  Glad to have this long week here."
"21","  Construction."
"22","  No, no, no, no.  We do commercial buildings, we do the envelope on the building."
"23","  Oh yeah."
"24","  ________ we can."
"25","  None that I know of."
"26","  Well, I took that over-the-counter stuff.  What is it? NyQuil, DayQuil, something like that."
"27","  Did not seem to change a thing."
"28","  Well, coughing wakes me up."

"37","   You get her off my back, I guess."
"38","  Oh, must have been 18 years ago, I guess."
"39","  I am usually fit as a fiddle."
"40","  Right, right, all the time."
"41","  hm, no, no."
"42","  No, cannot say that I have."
"43","  Yeah, get my girlfriend off my back."
"44","  Swelling in my ankle?  No, no."
"45","  Oh, no, no."
"46","  Oh, oh."
"47","  No, no."
"48","   I am not generally in a pretty good mood, I think."
"49","  Hmm, no, no."
"50","  Well, I tried to get in, but I have not been for a while."
"51","  Drinking?"
"52","  Oh, well, I have a couple of beers a night with dinner, you know."
"53","  Well, you know, I have my pizza and usually and you know, 2-3 beers.  When watching a ball game on the weekend, I might have three or four."
"54","  Oh, yeah."
"55","  Oh shoot, if it is a good game, I might have a six pack."
"56","  No, no.  I do not like the hard stuff."
"57","  Oh, no, no."
"58","  No, cannot say that that anybody has ever missed my direction."
"59","  Well stays about the same, stays about the same."
"60","  No, like street stuff?"
"61","  Oh, I do not fool with this."
"62","  No, no,  I do not think so."
"63","  Correct."
"64","  Well, let me see.  Yeah, I think I had one once upon a time a while back."
"65","  Television thing, they put up your butt."
"66","  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"67","  No, it was normal."
"68","  Oh."
"69","  Just my partner."
"70","  Well, I am up and down ladders all day long and in and out of cherry pickers."
"71","  Oh, no, no.  Oh.  She is always on our job checking us out."
"72","  Oh, no, no."
"73","  All right, it would be pretty good."
"74","  Oh, I got to have some meat now."
"75","  Now I have my Meat Eaters pizza, you know."
"76","  Got three meats on that."
"77","  So you know, you know."
"78","  Double sausage in the pepperoni, you know, sprinkle some bacon on there."
"79","  Well, I will grab a cheeseburger from now and then and then again I might have a, you know, ham and cheese sandwich."
"80","  Oh, my partner."
"81","  Well, hmm, no, no."
"82","  No, no.  Cannot say I have had any changes in my vision."
"83","  Well, not really."
"84","  Yeah, yeah.   Get that diarrhea from time to time."
"85","  Hmm, no, no."
"86","  Yeah, yeah."
"87","   Oh, let us see.  They have been talking about it.  I know they showed up one day with that where they put the stick in your nose."
"88","  I guess that is common. "
"89","  Oh."
"90","  Oh, hm hm."
"91","  Hmm hmm, you bet, you bet."
"92","  I see, I see."
"93","  Oh good."
"94","  No, no, not at all."
"95","  Well, I just drink beer."
"96","  Oh."
"97","   Hmm."
"98","  I will stick it on the radar."
"99","  Oh, no."
"100","  Well, it is something to consider."
"101","  Well, sounds like you think it is something that I need to do, and if it gets the old lady off my back, I guess it would be all right."
"102","  Ha, I see, I see."
"103","  All right."
"104","  No.  I will let her know."
"105","  Yes."
"106","  Thank you."
"107","  My pleasure."
"108","  Well, let us see here.  I will try this.  Seems to let us see, well."
