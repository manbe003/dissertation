"1","  Hi there, Mr. Jones.  Hi, I think you might be muted on your camera.  I am having trouble hearing you.  There might be a little button on the bottom of your computer there.  That is okay.  If you look on your screen, Mr. Jones, maybe on the bottom right, there might be a microphone button."
"2","  There we go.  Oh, good, I can hear you now."
"3","  Well, good to meet you.  My name is Ben.  I am a medical student with the University of Washington, here to see you today.  How are you doing?"
"4","  Sure, fair.  And is it, is it okay, do you go by Mr. Jones or can I call you something else?"
"5","  All right.  Well, what brings you in today?"
"6","  What brings you to the doctors today?"
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Been a whole year, okay.  How have you been feeling since that year?"
"9","  More tired more easily, okay.  And is this like tired feeling like you need to go to sleep, or tired like you cannot do the things that you normally do during the day?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Sure, sure."
"12","  Yeah, I, completely understandable.  That is fun that you have grandkids though.  How old are your grandkids?"
"13","  Oh man that, that that is some work."
"14","  Parents busy at work and you guys kind of help out."
"15","  Okay, sure, sure and so you mainly it sounds like you feel this tired sensation towards the end of the day after doing work, seeing the kids and stuff.  Is that fair to say?"
"16","  Yeah.  Do you feel better in the morning after getting a good night's sleep? Feel refreshed?"
"17","  Yeah, yeah, definitely."
"18","  Yeah, yeah, it could be."
"19","  Right.  It is hard to know for sure.  It can definitely happen with getting older, but it can happen with other stuff too and we just need to make sure that it is, you know, not anything scary.  Is there anything else that comes with this tired sensation at all? or you feel any other symptoms?"
"20","  Sure."
"21","  Yeah."
"22","  Sure, sure, and I know you mentioned your diabetic Mr. Jones.  Have you been taking medications for your diabetes over this past year?"
"23","  What medications have you been on?"
"24","  Okay and have been on that the same dose over the last year, no changes?"
"25","   Okay.  And are you pretty good about taking your medications, no missed doses or anything like that?"
"26","  Okay, okay.  Not like whole weeks or anything without taking it?"
"27","  Yeah.  Do you check your blood sugars when you are at home?"
"28","  Yeah.  How have they been looking?"
"29","  Okay.  Is that normally where you are or is that higher than your normal?"
"30","  Okay.  Yeah, I noticed, you know, just looking back in your chart, the previous data we had for you, the hemoglobin A1c, I do not know if you are familiar with that or remember that, that is kind of a guesstimate on what your blood sugar looks like over a certain span of time, was creeping up too, so and it sounds like you have been on the same stable medications.  Has your diet or amount of exercise changed at all over the past year or so?"
"31","  Hard when you are tired, yeah."
"32","  Yeah."
"33","  Sure, yeah, yeah, definitely.  And then have you noticed, I know you feel fatigued, but do you have muscle pain or loss of sensation or any other kind of neurologic symptoms like that?"
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Yeah, yeah.  How have your legs been doing since then?  Have you, are you _______ found that? That is okay."
"36","  Sure, sure, yeah.  And then just a couple of more questions.  Before this year, have you had this kind of progression of fatigue happening to you before?"
"37","  Yeah."
"38","  Yeah, ha ha ha."
"39","  Hmm."
"40","  Yeah, ha ha ha."
"41","  Yeah, sure."
"42","  Yeah."
"43","  Yeah, definitely, yeah.  Well, it is frustrating when you have those symptoms, especially with lots of life stuff happening.  I mean you have grandkids, you want to hang out with, sounds like you got a wife that you want to spend time with too and you are still working, so that takes a lot of energy and when you do not have that, that is frustrating, so but I think we can get down to the cause of it and I think with your history of diabetes and not seeing a doctor in a little bit, the first place to start is just checking your blood sugar, checking the A1c, getting some labs to make sure that that has not skyrocketed because if your blood sugar is out of control that can definitely leave you with a sense of feeling tired and not yourself, so umm, before diving into a whole bunch of tests, I think that is a good place to start.  How do you feel about that?"
"44","  Yeah and in the meantime, we will just hold the course and see what those labs show and then if, if warranted, we may tweak your medications a little bit if your blood sugar is high and see if that will help with some energy levels."
"45","  Does that sound okay?  Do you have any other concerns or questions for me?"
"46","  I do not think we are there yet hopefully, but we will see what the labs show."
"47","  Yeah, definitely and if we."
"48","  Yeah."
"49","  There you go.  Get you some energy, so you can hang out with those grandkids."
"50","  There you go.  Alright Mr. Jones, well, it is a pleasure meeting you and hopefully, we can get you some answers and get you feeling better here shortly."
"51","  Of course, yeah.  You have a good day."
"52","  Bye."
