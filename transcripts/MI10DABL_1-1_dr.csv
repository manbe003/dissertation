"1","  Hey Freddie, how is it going?"
"2","  Good.  Well, my name is Parker, I am one of the student doctors working in the clinic today, so I will chat with you and see what has been going on and we will come up with a plan from there, so before we sort out, I just want to make sure that we cover everything you were hoping to cover today, so what brings you in?"
"3","  Okay, and I saw something mentioned in the chart about some concerns about fatigue, is that correct?"
"4","  Okay, well yeah, I think we can both talk about how the diabetes management has been going and then also address sort of this new fatigue you have been having, so I guess first starting out with the diabetes, how do you feel like it has been going?"
"5","  Okay.  I have doubt that you are taking the metformin and the glipizide.  Are you still taking both of those?"
"6","  Sure, that is definitely not an uncommon thing to forget to take doses.  In a two-week time period, how often would you say you missed a dose?"
"7","  Okay, okay.  I know you have been on them for some time, but any new side effects that you have noticed like upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?"
"8","  Okay.  Do you usually take them at a specific time or just kind of whenever you remember?"
"9","  First thing in the morning, okay."
"10","  Do you have like a one of those like pill counters or like anything that helps you remember to take them or do you just kind of have them sitting out?"
"11","  Okay, okay.  How often do you check your blood sugars at home?"
"12","  215, okay.  What do they typically run when you check them at home?"
"13","  Okay."
"14","  Yeah.  Do you check them at consistent times a day or is it more of kind of when you are thinking about it that you check them?"
"15","  Okay.  Would you generally say you take them before meal or after a meal?"
"16","  After a meal, okay.  Immediately after, like a couple hours after?"
"17","  Okay.  Okay.  And the reason why I asked that as I am sure you know, you know, if you take it immediately after the meal, then that is something that we would expect the blood sugar to be a little bit higher, whereas a couple hours after the meal, we would expect it to be kind of the more level that you would be normally sitting at.  Okay, and then in terms of diet and exercise, what does a typical day of meals look like for you?"
"18","  Okay.  Looking back to your chart, I noticed your hemoglobin A1c, which is the thing that we use to sort of measure how you are doing in terms of your blood sugar control, it was initially pretty good when we started you on the medications and then over the past couple of years, it has crept up a little bit.  It looks like your last one in 2021 was 7.9.  Do you feel like there have been any changes in terms of like your day to day diet or habits that have been different?"
"19","  Excellent."
"20","  Okay, okay.  You said the walks are couple of times a week, any other exercise?"
"21","  Right.  Do you mind me asking you seem a little tense today?  Is there something that has been going or bugging you?"
"22","  Okay, I see.  Yeah, it is completely understandable.  You are definitely not alone and it has been a weird transition for a lot of us.  Has there been anything else going on at home or any environment that has made it hard to, like make these video calls?"
"23","  Okay.  Have you ever had any periods where you felt like really anxious or really down?"
"24","  Oh, okay.  It has been a weird couple years for everyone.  Has there been any new stressors in your life that have been really weighing on you recently?"
"25","  Yeah, well, let us talk about that fatigue.  How long ago did you first start noticing it?"
"26","  Okay.  Has it felt like it is progressively gotten worse since you first noticed it or has it stayed about the same?"
"27","  Okay and is it after activity or does it feel like you get up in the morning and just feel really fatigued, like just kind of right off the back?"
"28","  Okay, and remind me what you do for work?"
"29","  Okay, so probably pretty busy day to day, ah?"
"30","  Does it feel like there have been any changes in terms of what is going on at work that would make you more tired?"
"31","  Okay. Okay.  What about at home, any changes there that you feel like have been weighing on you or just taking a lot of energy out? I think you had mentioned earlier something about the grandkids."
"32","  It just does not really feel like you have the energy to be able to do it even though you want to."
"33","  How is your sleep?"
"34","  How many hours would you say you get every night?"
"35","  Okay.  Do you feel like you sleep through the night or toss and turn a lot or wake up?"
"36","  Okay.  How is your appetite then?"
"37","  Okay.  Have you had any weight loss or weight gain over the last few months that you have noticed? "
"38","  No recent illnesses, fever, chills. "
"39","  Okay. Okay.  Anything else that you have noticed about these fatigue episodes or sort of anything that you can think of that is correlated to the start of all this?"
"40","  Frequent urination?"
"41","  When did you first notice that?"
"42","  Okay.  Does it feel like when you do go to the bathroom, are you able to empty your bladder completely or does it feel like there is still something left?"
"43","  Okay.  You have not noticed any, like changes in your urine like that it is discolored or like cloudy?"
"44","  Okay.  Okay.  Any changes to your bowel habits?  So like diarrhea, constipation?"
"45","  Okay.  What was that in the background just now?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Is that something that happens often?"
"48","  Okay.  Would you say generally you feel safe in your home environment? "
"49","  Okay, good.  Who is all at home with you?"
"50","  Okay. Where sre you guys living at?"
"51","  Okay, gotcha.  Okay.  So, we have talked about the fatigue. Any changes in like alcohol consumption or tobacco use over the last few months?"
"52","  Okay. How often would you say you have an alcoholic beverage?"
"53","  Okay.  Do you smoke or use tobacco?"
"54","  No.  Okay.  Any other drugs?  marijuana, cocaine, heroin?"
"55","  Okay.  Have you had any hospitalizations for anything in the past?"
"56","  Okay.  Any major surgeries previously?"
"57","  Okay.  In terms of medications, you currently take just the metformin and the glipizide."
"58","  Okay. Anything else like over-the-counter like vitamins, aspirin?"
"59","  No.  Okay. Okay.  Is there anything that we did not cover today that you were wanting to talk about?"
"60","  Okay."
"61","  (Laughs) I am glad to hear that and just know if there is anything else that, you know, there is something you wanted to bring up at any point, you can always reach out, you know, and talk to the office about.  So, I think that was a good jumping off point would be.  So, it sounds like you have been working on physical activity for the diabetes management, which is great, though walks, you know, a couple of times a week, I think is really going to help with your blood sugar control.  I do think that what we should do is get a repeat hemoglobin A1c to see where you are at this year, and then you do have some room to go up on your metformin.  So, I think if we are not quite there yet, I think that gives us a little bit of room to work with and then in terms of this fatigue, you know, it is hard to say, right, like, it sounds like something that you have been, you know, really busy at work and there is also a lot of energy happening at home, and so, I think it is hard to say right after that what exactly is causing it, but I think a reasonable next step would to be also to get some labs.  So, when you go for the hemoglobin A1c draw, I am also going to send a couple of other labs looking at your thyroid and your blood count because sometimes things that are different in the thyroid can cause sort of fatigue and then things like anemia can also be causing it.  So, you do not have any symptoms that are like really big red flags for me, but I think it would just be worth checking out to see if it is something that you know, we can identify and correct because we want you to have the energy to be able to play with your grandkids.  Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you? "
"62","  Okay, okay. Any other questions or concerns before I let you go?"
"63","  Okay. Okay.  Well, let us do that.  I will send those orders and then I will follow up with you from there.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming in today, Freddy."
"64","  Alright.  Take care."
