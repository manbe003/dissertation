"1","  Cause some problems.  Oops, one sec, okay.  And then, yeah and – so that’s something we are going to do for your, the fatigue that you have been having.  You know, it is possible that the fatigue could be something else, but that’s what I would like to start with first and see if that is the reason why."
"2","  And then for your diabetes, I am just going to put some lab work in to check your hemoglobin A1c since it has been a few months as well and get another reading in and take a look at your kidney function because that could tell us a little bit about not only your diabetes, but your blood pressure as well."
"3","  And I think once we get a new reading, we may want to talk a little bit about your medications, either increasing or adding insulin, something that we think might be helpful for you.  "
"4"," But let us take a look at that first reading and it sounds like you do get some home-cooked meals which is really great."
"5","  I do see that there is a lot of carbohydrates and fatty meats in your diet which may be making your diabetes a bit worse, especially with the added stress."
"6","  So, do you feel comfortable with changing your diet a little bit or do you…?"
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Yeah, and you know it does not have to be all at once.  I am thinking more along the lines of just changing a few things, maybe in the morning substituting hash browns with some fruit at lunch that might be a challenging one for you since you are on the run."
"9","  Yeah and you know, with dinner maybe a few less potatoes and just adding a vegetable, any kind of greens or if there is anything that you particularly like that would be a good time to add that in."
"10","  Yeah, depending on, I mean, it is good to know that, you know, depending on how those are cooked, if there is a lot of butter, whatnot or salt. "
"11","  Right, I know, but that would probably cause a little bit more damage to your diabetes than help you in that way just with the salt and the butter.  How about this, would you be open to seeing a dietitian so that she could talk to you a little bit more about your diet?"
"12","  Okay.  Yeah, I just think she would have some good ideas and she works with you know people all the time with their diet and people who have really busy schedules and she has got a few tips that could help you out, so that you can make it as easy as you can."
"13","  Okay.  I will put a referral in for her and another great thing is you can do it through telemedicine, so you do not necessarily have to come into the clinic for that.  Yeah, okay.  Any other questions?"
"14","  Okay.  So we are going to put some lab work in just to check your diabetes and check that PSA, that prostate level and then we talked a little bit about checking your blood pressure two or three times a week.  If you can write those numbers down, and just either bring them into the clinic next time we see each other or send them through MyChart if you have it, just so that we can get that baseline."
"15","  Yeah, yeah and then lastly, just putting in that referral to a dietitian and so that she can just help you a little bit more about what works for you in terms of diet."
"16","  Does that sound like a good plan to you?"
"17","  Okay.  Any other questions or anything else I can help with?"
"18","  Okay.  All right, so after we get that lab work in, we will give you a call with those results and then we will see what in terms of followup when we want to see you."
"19","  All right, all right. Okay.  It was nice to meet you Freddie."
"20","  Yeah and you can go ahead and log off now."
