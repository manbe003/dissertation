"1","  Hi, my name is Bren, ______ pronounced.  How would you like to be referred to in this visit?"
"2","  Okay great.  Well, we're going to be doing the telehealth visit today and so we'll be trying to do as much as possible as we can over the screen.  Tell me a little bit about why you're here today?"
"3","  Yeah, and why did she want you to come in?"
"4","  Yeah, it sounds like you have someone in your life concerned about you and that's great.  So it sounds like the primary thing that you have going on right now are cough and a runny nose.  How long has that been going on for?"
"5","  Okay.  And are you having any other symptoms currently like having a fever or a temperature?"
"6","  Yeah.  How long would you say you have that for?"
"7","  Yeah.  And have you taken your temperature or do you just kind of feel like a little bit warm?"
"8","  Okay.  So having this cough, some runny nose and now maybe feeling a little bit worse the past couple of days.  Have you noticed anything else over the past couple days?"
"9","  Yeah, that's a good thought.  That's something we can certainly do.  Some of your symptoms are certainly in line with a mild case of COVID.  Is there anything that makes you worried about having COVID like any known exposures?"
"10","  Yeah.  Have you been around anyone that you know has COVID?"
"11","  I know, I guess that's kind of a problem isn’t it?"
"12","  Yeah.  Have you been hanging out with any one without a mask on or have you been able to social distance?"
"13","  Yeah, okay. Well, good.  Well, it sounds like you've been relatively safe, but I hear you that, maybe getting a COVID test would be something that would be helpful, especially since some of your symptoms kind of have some overlap.  How does that sound to you?"
"14","  I want to ask about a few other symptoms to see what else might be going on.  Have you felt more tired or like kind of achy than usual?"
"15","  Okay and how long has that been going on for?"
"16","  Okay, so that's maybe they are lasting a little bit longer than just a fever."
"17","  Okay.  Are you having any trouble breathing right now?"
"18","  Okay.  How about any chest pain?"
"19","  Okay.  Any headache?"
"20","  Any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea, so basically any changes in your GI system?"
"21","  Off and on, okay.  And how long was off and on for?"
"22","  Okay.  There may be some kind of some changes to your GI system over the past couple of years.  Have you ever noticed any blood in your stool or any mucus?"
"23","  Okay.  Have you lost any weight recently that you weren’t intending to lose?"
"24","  Okay.  I know I've asked a lot of questions about ______ symptoms and kind of any trouble things, is there anything else that you're kind of thinking about like, oh maybe I should mention this that we haven't talked about yet?"
"25","  Okay.  Do you have any medical diagnoses like do you take medications daily for anything?"
"26","  Okay.  So been in generally pretty good health ha?"
"27","  Yeah.  Oh I guess must have been pretty good if you've been able to avoid the doctor for 10 years, right?"
"28","  Okay, good.  Well, I think so there are a few things that you already brought up and so one is the COVID test and I think that, that's very reasonable.  And after our visit I ______ you have some information about how to get that done.  How does that sound?"
"29","  Okay.  And just we're not in-person, things like you know listening to heart, lungs, obviously I can't do, but do you ever have your blood pressure checked like at the fire department or at the pharmacy or anything like that?"
"30","  Okay.  Well, I think at some point, it would be nice for us to check and see you in person, but obviously over the telehealth visit we'll just kind of put a pin in that and do that when we get to see you in person."
"31","  But just ______ some of the other things you're describing kind of feeling fatigued over the past couple of weeks and kind of having some bowel issues, I do just think maybe some basic labs will be very helpful for us to check and so something that looks at your blood count to see may be if you have some anemia that's going on, that's the red blood cells and sometimes most of the people can get tired.  And then something else called the BMP which is the basic metabolic panel, that just looks at basically the balance of different electrolytes in your blood.  And that can indicate to us if something is up and in you I would expect it to be relatively normal, but I think it would be something that would be helpful."
"32","  Okay.  And then also based on your age, let's see, you're 58, is that correct?"
"33","  Okay.  And have you ever had a colonoscopy before."
"34","  A colonoscopy, so it's a camera that looks at the inside of your GI tract."
"35","  Okay, and when was that?  Do you remember how long ago that was?"
"36","  Okay, and do you remember being normal or did they want you to come back kind of in a short time period?"
"37","  Okay, good.  Well, I'll just put out to those records and make sure we're following up on the appropriate timeline.  If everything was normal, usually it is every 10 years."
"38","  And then have you had any other concern come up that you feel like we haven’t talked about yet today?"
"39","  Okay.  So, so far we talked about getting the COVID test done and then some basic labs.  And then the final thing I like to talk with all my patients about is just how you are generally with your health?  I think we focused a lot on medicine and different diagnoses, but there's a lot of other things that make up your health.  How have you been sleeping recently?"
"40","  Good, that's great.  And how do you stay active?"
"41","  Yeah, I hear you.  You mentioned you've been sleeping more, why did you think that is?"
"42","  Yeah, yeah, but I think some of those basic labs will kind of be a good jumping-off point for us to kind of get some idea about what might be causing your fatigue."
"43","  And then, you know, thinking big picture health, especially during this really stressful time, I know for a lot of people that I talk to, things like smoking or drug use or alcohol use have all kind of changed during the pandemic.  How has that been for you?"
"44","  Yeah.  Do you use any tobacco products?"
"45","  Okay, what about any drug products including marijuana?"
"46","  Okay and then what about alcohol use?"
"47","  Yes.  And when you say a couple beers now and then, how often would you say you drink a couple of beers?"
"48","  On a weekend, okay."
"49","  Do you ever feel like you're drinking is a problem for you or do you feel okay about for right now?"
"50","  Okay, all right.  Well, it sounds like you kind of have, you know, three things going on, you know this tiredness over the past couple of years, and now some more acute symptoms.  We want to investigate your COVID.  But I think, you know, at least from what we can see through the screen, it seems like things are going okay.  There is a plan that we've come up with so far namely the COVID test and then the two odd tests, does that sound okay?"
"51","  Okay.  What questions do you have for me?"
"52","  Okay, all right.  Well, once we get the COVID-19 test results back, well, you know, what those look like, and same with the lab results.  I'll send you information on where to get those done and then based on those we'll kind of go from there."
"53","  All right, it was nice to meet you Tom."
"54","  Take care."
"55","  Okay."
