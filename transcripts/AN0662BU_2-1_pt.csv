"1","  Is that the one, is that the one I need?"
"2","  Hey hello."
"3","  Where is, oh good, do we need the other light on?"
"4","  It looks like there is a, there.  Okay, good. Hi."
"5","  Yes I guess so.  I am just getting used to doing everything on TV here.  It is kind of strange."
"6","  Freddie Jones, not Freddie Correct."
"7","  Yes, just Freddie is great, yes clear."
"8","  Yes, yes, sounds good."
"9","  Well, I am disappointed to be diabetic that is for sure, normally I come in and see the doctor like every four months or so and, but you know for over a year now, I have not been and the last time was kind of irritating because they told me I could not eat anymore fried chicken, but that seemed really strange to me.  But I figure, I better get back on track.  I want to take care of my health and take care of my diabetes.  So here I am."
"10","  Yes."
"11","  I do that a couple of times a week and today is Saturday, I did that this morning."
"12","  Usually about, I do not know, about 200, it was 210 today."
"13","  No it is the fasting, just first thing."
"14","  Right."
"15","  Yes."
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Actually, I am short on them now, I should get some more I guess."
"18","  I guess I will have to get refills.  I take them twice a day, both of them twice a day, so they go faster than you think they would, but you know I usually take them as prescribed."
"19","  Oh yes, that is kind of what I was thinking.  Not very often though, maybe every couple of weeks or so."
"20","  Well, everything is difficult nowadays, but now that you do not, if you did your shots you can go out without masks, so it should get easier to do things."
"21","  Either of, I am sorry…?"
"22","  I guess so as long as it fits with the Premera Blue Cross plan that I get through work."
"23","  Okay, cool."
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Yes I guess so.  Yes maybe not every day, but it is a good reminder thanks, yes I will do that, yes."
"26","  Not so much anymore, I guess, I think basically the medications that I have been on, I mean it has been eight years plus or whatever now, so I have not really had that kind of foot pain, leg pain as much since we get the balance of the different drugs and stuff, so but I will look at it more often I guess."
"27","  Yes."
"28","  No, I have not been to any doctors in the last year or so."
"29","  Yes, pretty much, everything has been on hold for over a year now."
"30","  Okay."
"31","  Not for a while.  I had one I guess through this road, it would be the same provider.  So I do not know, I do not want to guess."
"32","  I guess so, yes sure."
"33","  Yes, I guess it is regular.  It is just walking, but I try to do that more than I used to do it, so maybe a couple of times a week."
"34","  It depends on the weather, you know how it is in the Northwest, you are going to have great plans, but not anymore."
"35","  Usually, 10-15 minutes maybe."
"36","  Well, that is a family thing on the weekends, you know because it is more than just a food, it is the chance to gather together and stuff like that, like get to spend more time with my grandkids and my kids of course you know, but yes my wife is just an excellent cook and I have been relying on her for 35 years to feed me, and so it seems to be working out pretty well so far."
"37","  Oh, well, yes.  It is a family thing, so other people bring things, you know people bring potato salad and so there are lots of things to eat, vegetables and things, so it is not just…"
"38","  Not just sit around and gobbling down fried chicken."
"39","  In order to get her, she does not like her picture taken.  I do not think she wants to be on TV so I think it will be hard to talk Louise into doing that."
"40","  Well, I am not really sure what I can change, I mean it seems like that would be kind of awkward, so…"
"41","  Who the…"
"42","  Oh…"
"43","  I guess, yes."
"44","  Can you like send me something about that or?"
"45","  Well, the main reason that I came in is I am just tired all the time and so what should I do about that.  That is - the main thing is I need to be able to keep up with my grandkids and they are pretty fast move around the, the 8-year-old is always in charge of everybody.  She thinks she is the boss now and then the 5-year-old just kind of goes along with whatever she comes up with.  But just when you think you got them under control, the 2-year-old is causing some problem, it is like herding cats.  So…"
"46","  I just get so tired out and sometimes I just need to go lie down and take rest for a while before I can do anything."
"47","  When Louise has been taking care of the kids all afternoon, when our daughter is at work and the grandkids are with her and then she needs a break too and when I come home from work and I am just exhausted, I cannot keep up with them."
"48","  I do not know.  Especially the last year or so maybe."
"49","  Yes, the last couple of years."
"50","  That is kind of what worries me, am I just getting old and running out of steam? You know am I going to just wake up dead tomorrow or is that being just is this the end of everything or…?"
"51","  Because I really would like to be able to keep up with my grandkids, you know as they grow up and…"
"52","  No."
"53","  No, not that I can think of."
"54","  Weight?  No."
"55","  No."
"56","  No."
"57","  Most of the time I guess.  Sometimes I just wake up and I am tired already, yes it is, by the time I get my socks on I am ready to take a nap."
"58","  Usually about 10."
"59","  About 6 maybe, or about 5"
"60","  ___ I sleep pretty soundly, yes."
"61","  She says that sometimes, but actually she is the one that snores.  I have heard her.  I guess she is just embarrassed and she tries to make it out to be somebody else."
"62","  Well, more than I used to, I will tell you that.  I have been used to have to take a nap, but sometimes at work I just kind of run out of steam and I think somebody is going to catch me one of these days, I don’t know."
"63","  Hmm."
"64","  Yes, probably.  Yes, it is kind of in between and sports right now the March Madness is over and baseball season is beginning, they are geared up and everything and they are getting, well they, I am sorry, and get me going on that there are lots of good…"
"65","  Well, that's something you can do on a weekend and do not have to do too much planning, there is always something on."
"66","  No."
"67","  I would say it kind of fluctuates.  You know, sometimes it seems like more often than others but, I do not know, maybe it is a little bit more than it used to be."
"68","  Probably, yes, I do not know.  It is like as long as I am getting up to do it, and so just waking up and having done it, you know that is not in the plan."
"69","  No, no, no, so far no."
"70","  So just basically I want to keep up with the grandkids and stay alive a little bit longer and manage my diabetes as best I can."
"71","  Not that I can think of, no."
"72","  Okay, nice to meet you, what is it, Jordan?"
"73","  Yes, it sure is.  Thanks again."
