"1","  Hello, Mr. Thompson."
"2","  I am doing well.  I am Valerie, I am a student doctor here to see you today.  What name do you prefer to go by?"
"3","  Tom, okay, nice to meet you, Tom.  So, tell me why you are here today?"
"4","  Okay.  Tell me what you’re feeling?"
"5","  Okay, okay.  So, how long this has been going on?"
"6","  All right.  Any fever?"
"7","  Okay.  You’re having any chills or sweats at night?"
"8","  Okay, good.  When you state you have a little bit of a cough, what do you feel like where in your chest do you feel like it’s coming from or throat?"
"9","  Okay.  Are you coughing anything up?"
"10","  Let’s take a look there.  When you or is it, are you coming up with clear phlegm, greenish what would you say?"
"11","  Off-white, okay.  Are you having any sore throat at all?"
"12","  All right.  How about any nasal congestion?"
"13","  Okay.  Do you have that feeling of you’re having the congestion sort of running down the back of your throats?"
"14","  Pressure, okay.  Have you ever had seasonal allergies?"
"15","  Okay, good, all right.  Any, so I am going to ask you about some of the symptoms of COVID, are you having any shortness of breath?"
"16","  How about loss of taste or smell?"
"17","  Diarrhea or?"
"18","  Intestinal?"
"19","  But not in the last three or four days necessarily?"
"20","  Okay."
"21","  Okay, all right and are you tried any, have you have been taking any over-the-counter medications to see if anything helps?"
"22","  All right and how does that work for you?"
"23","  Yeah, does that kind of clear things up allow you to breathe a little better through your nose and calm the cough?"
"24","  Okay, okay.  So, what I am hearing it sounds like exactly like what you said it sounds like a cold, it doesn’t sound like you have symptoms that are concerning for COVID, although if you would like to come in and get into the clinic, we could do a COVID test on you real quick and you know run a COVID and flu test but I think you know but if it’s just a cold virus you are managing it as well as you can, you just you know keep resting, drinking fluids, the NyQuil is fine, you know I think you are doing the right thing.  So, what you’re saying to me doesn’t have concerning symptoms for anything that might get a lot worse?"
"25","  It is a bigger concern the last couple of years definitely."
"26","  Yeah, if your symptoms do continue to get worse then you know definitely come in and get tested especially if you start to develop more of a cough or any shortness of breath, fever, those kind of things then that might get a little bit more concerning?"
"27","  Well, you’re 58, right?"
"28","  So, have you been up to date at all with you know the recommendations in terms of cancer screening, colonoscopy, prostate screening that kind of thing?"
"29","  Okay, that’s something you might want to consider and that’s something that if you come in for a general checkup, a doctor would talk with you about scheduling those at your age that would be a pretty smart thing to do.  Usually, we start those screenings around 45 or 50 depending on somebody’s family history.  So, yeah, we could definitely if you want, we can definitely schedule and I would recommend we schedule you with the primary care physician to just come in, get a just a regular you know checkup exam, blood work done and see where you are at and then they could talk with you about you know some of those age recommended screenings."
"30","  Okay."
"31","  You have to come in.  You know they want to do a physical exam and draw some blood for a blood work.  So, yeah you would have to come to the clinic."
"32","  But the schedules are usually pretty wide open, sometimes there is even availabilities on Saturdays.  So, you know, we could work with your schedule."
"33","  Right, yeah, lots of people and so that’s why lot of places now have Saturday option, so."
"34","  We could figure that out."
"35","  Yeah, they probably want to do a standard, it’s been a while since you had any of it, they probably want to look at things like your blood sugar level, your hemoglobin just to see where you know make sure you’re not anemic anything like that.  They just have a kind of a standard panel of blood work that they usually look at and that’s then they compare that back to your last time and see where you are at compare to your baseline or if you don’t have one, this is kind of sets you up as a baseline for you know in case you have any problems in the future?  Yeah, it’s good data to know and it’s not usually I mean there is a standard panel, not expensive, insurance covers it because it’s part of you know standard recommended preventative checkup.  So, insurance should definitely cover it and then physical exam would look at things like your general health, teeth, ears, eyes, mouth, heart, lungs you know, they would potentially if you’re interested do pelvic exam and look at you know male health things.  If they were going to do a prostate screening, they would also look at that in the future, so."
"36","  That is part of the, they don’t do it as frequently now and the doctor can talk to you about whether that’s recommended for you first specifically or not, it would have to do with family history you know."
"37","  There is some different data now on whether or not that’s always recommended.  So, that’s something you would want to, you would talk with the doctor about."
"38","  So, yeah.  If you’re interested we could have the nurse talk with you about scheduling the checkup with the primary care doctor here on a schedule that works for you?"
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Okay, all right.  Well, we’re here when and if you want to call back and schedule that."
"41","  Okay. Would you like, we have some information I think some brochures that like just a PDF I could send to you about kind of recommended age checkups if that would be something that interests you?"
"42","  Okay, all right.  Well, any other question, Tom."
"43","  Okay.  Well, feel free to call us back anytime and we’ll see you here or in the clinic and I hope you start feeling better."
"44","  All right."
"45","  Take care."
"46","  Bye, bye."
