"1","  Hi, Tom.  How are you?   Oh, looks like you're on mute here, Tom."
"2","  Good.  How are you doing today?  "
"3","  Alright, looks like we got your appointment because you have some COVID symptoms here."
"4","  Okay.  Do you know if you have any contacts with other people who have tested positive for COVID recently?"
"5","  Okay.  And what other symptoms do you have other than this cough here?"
"6","  Okay.  And you said it started about a week ago?"
"7","  Alright. Have your symptoms gotten any worse or better over the course of the last week? "
"8","  About the same.  Okay.  Are you taking any medications or anything?"
"9","  Just DayQuil.  Is that helping you out?"
"10","  Okay.  Is there anyone else that you live with in your house?"
"11","  Girlfriend and does she have any symptoms as well?"
"12","   No.  Alright. Is there anything in particular that made you think it was COVID?"
"13","  Okay.  And are you currently going to work?"
"14","  Alright.  And so you are going to the workplace?"
"15","   Okay.  Umm. Well, yeah, I do think it is a good idea to get a COVID test.  Have you done that since you have been feeling any of these symptoms?"
"16","  No, does that interest you at all?"
"17","  Okay.  Let us see.  Do you know of a testing center that is located close to where you are at that you are able to access?"
"18","  Okay, is the library easy for you to access?  Is that close to where you're at?"
"19","  Yeah,  Okay, let me see. Alright.  I do think the library is doing a testing.  Um, it is a little bit. I think today is after hours.  Do you know if you would be able to make it tomorrow?"
"20","  When you get off work. What time do you get off work?"
"21","  About 5, okay, yeah, I think they are open until about 7 here. so, so this is between that window after you get off before 7 work for you. "
"22","  Alright.  Let us see.  Sorry, can you tell me all the other symptoms you are feeling, other than the cough you said you are feeling tired and that?"
"23","  Okay.  Is there any color in the mucus?"
"24","  No.  Okay.  Um, do you have seasonal allergies or anything?"
"25","  Yeah. Okay, any other symptoms other than feeling tired, coughing up mucus?"
"26","  A fever.  Do you have any idea how high you are running?"
"27","  You do not have a thermometer, Okay, but your girlfriend probably said you are running pretty warm."
"28","  Any night sweats or anything like that?"
"29","  Nope.  Have you noticed any change of appetite or anything over the last week?"
"30","  No  Let us see. Have you noticed any loss of smell or taste?"
"31","  No.  Food still tasting good for you."
"32","  Okay, good.  Um, let us see. You have not noticed any rashes or any other skin changes? "
"33","  No.   No vomiting or nausea."
"34","  Okay.  Let us see.  Have you noticed any changes in your hearing or anything?"
"35","  No.   Okay, well like I said, I do think the best option here is probably to go get you tested for COVID and let us see.  Yeah, if you can, if you can do that tomorrow, that would be great and then um, if things do not get better within the next week, I would like you to give us a call back so that we can check on you again and maybe get you in the office to be able to check on you."
"36","  Do you have any questions for me?"
"37","  Nope.   Alright, can you repeat back the plan that we kind of formed here today?"
"38","  Yeah. Alright.  And you do not have any other questions for me? "
"39","  And these symptoms are your only concern today?"
"40","  Alright, sounds great.  Well, this is really nice talking to you, Tom."
"41","   Yep. I hope you have a good night.  You are feeling better here."
"42","  Yep, have a good one."
"43","  Bye."
