"1","  Hello, Mr. Johnson."
"2","  My name is Maddy.  I am a medical student working at the clinic today.  How are you?"
"3","  Sorry to hear that.  What brings you in today?"
"4","  Well, I am glad that you are seeing us.  It sounds like it's a good idea.  Your girlfriend had a good idea for you to be seen.  Can you tell me about your symptoms?  When did they start and what are they?"
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Yeah, I mean, one of the tricky things about COVID is that it looks different in so many different ways, in different people.  So, it's really hard to say just based on your symptoms alone, but it's possible that it is just a totally regular cold.  How long have you been having these symptoms?"
"7","  Last weekend."
"8","  Okay, okay.  Have you been around anyone that has been sick with you know, like anything, including COVID?"
"9","  Okay.  None of them have been sick at all."
"10","  So, it sounds like you said you have some head congestion, stuffiness, a cough, any sore throat?"
"11","  Okay.  Are you having any pain in your ears or your eyes?"
"12","  Okay and any stomach upset at all and whether that is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anything like that?"
"13","  Okay, it sounds like that's not new since you have had that."
"14","  Okay and then what about any rashes anywhere on your body?"
"15","  Okay.  You said you have had a fever.  Have you taken your temperature or you just kind of feel hot?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  No worries about that, all right.  And have you, this is kind of a silly question, but any like recent weight loss that you didn't mean to do?"
"18","  Okay, all right.  Any time that you are like sweating profusely at night or during the day?"
"19","  Okay, great.  Um, okay.  So, it sounds like you are having definitely some symptoms that could be COVID, but also could be regular cold, which is usually caused by some kind of virus.  The tricky thing is that it is really hard to tell without testing you for COVID whether it is or not."
"20","  So, I think it would probably be a good idea to go and do that, mostly because if you do have it, then there are ways that we would like you to kind of protect yourself and protect everyone else from spreading it that you wouldn't necessarily need to do quite as strictly if it were not COVID."
"21","  Either way, first of all, how does that sound to you?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Has she been having any of these symptoms?"
"24","  Okay and have you guys been around each other pretty frequently since they have started?"
"25","  Okay, okay.  Um, so I think, you know, it's up to her and I am not seeing her, but it might be a good idea for her to get tested as well.  Just because if you have been around each other, she could be, I am not by any means saying you have it, but if by chance you do, we want to know if she also might be asymptomatic and having it too."
"26","  Yeah, so it looks like..."
"27","   Yeah, so there are lots of different testing sites.  Where are you located now?"
"28","  Beacon Hill.  So, um, there should be a mobile van, I believe over there, but you can also go to the clinic website or the UDub website, and they will have lots of different testing locations that you can do."
"29","  And then in the meantime, have you been using anything to, to treat your symptoms?"
"30","  Okay and how often are you using those?"
"31","  Okay, all right.  Is that helping you?"
"32","  Okay.  Um, you know, it, it sounds like it's just a virus, whether it's COVID or not, it sounds like just a virus, which usually will go away on its own without necessarily needing to treat it other than just treating your symptoms.  So in, you know, you can keep taking the NyQuil and DayQuil.  I would recommend just not taking it too often, follow whatever the bottle says on it."
"33","  And, and then you can use like Tylenol to treat a fever if you are having a fever, that's making you uncomfortable."
"34","  But otherwise, you know, get lots of rest and, and kind of lay low."
"35","  Yeah, I am sorry you haven't been feeling well.  Have you ever had anything like this before?"
"36","   Okay, okay.  So I think, yeah, I think that is probably what I would recommend.  I would say, you know, if you are getting worse over the next week or so, so if you are having a hard time breathing, if you are having chest pain, if you are having headaches, like really bad headaches, it won't go away, if you are having a really bad like fever that just won't stop.  Those are the signs that it might be time to go to the emergency room and be seen there."
"37","  And I know that it sounds really scary, and you are definitely not there at this point, but I want to make sure that you know when to, when to give us a or at least give us a call back, so that we can help you out."
"38","  Okay, so that was a lot of information (Laughs)"
"39","  Can you make sure I was, you know, covered everything.  Can you repeat back to me kind of what we, what we talked about and what, what to do?"
"40","  Yeah, let me see if I can, I can find it for you, but let's see.  Do you have internet access?"
"41","  Okay.  Let's see, I think if you let me see.  Yeah, so if you go to like the CDC website or the City of Seattle website, or UW medicine website, all of those will have really easy, like, map finders of where you can get tested."
"42","  Okay, great.  Umm, and then I think, you know, the last thing that I would just reiterate is that if you are getting worse, instead of getting better over the next couple of weeks so, if you are having a worse cough, worse fever, if you are having trouble breathing, especially those would be some signs that you should give us a call back or go to the emergency room."
"43","  Okay."
"44","  Is there anything else that you were concerned about or that you want to talk about?"
"45","  Okay, all right.  Well, do you have any other questions for me about any of that?"
"46","  Okay, all right.  Well, um, thanks for seeing us.  You know, I know you didn't want to, but I think it is a really good idea to do that and feel free to give us a call back if you need to, okay?  Hope you feel better soon."
"47","  Great."
