"1","  Hello, are we connected now?"
"2","  Right, ready to start?"
"3","  That is good to me.  Hi, Freddie."
"4","  I am doing well.  My name is Edwin."
"5","  My name is Edwin."
"6","  Yeah, nice to meet you."
"7","  I am one of the medical students that is working with your physician today, so I am just going to ask you some stuff about your appointment today just to get more information so I can talk over with my attending.  Is that okay?"
"8","  All right, sounds good.  So can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?"
"9","  Okay.  That is great.   I am happy to hear that, you know, you are here so that we can actually see what is going on.  So I can see here that besides the routine care that you wanted just to come get, you also reported about feeling tired and maybe some imbalance in the past couple of months.  You tell me a little bit about that."
"10","  Yeah, tell me about it."
"11","  Okay.  Can you tell me when it started, the fatigue around?"
"12","  Okay and what about the imbalance?  When did you notice that starting to onset?"
"13","  Oh, okay, so okay, because from what it sounded like, what I can see in your notes, it looks, it sounds like you were having trouble standing sometimes."
"14","   Okay, okay.  That is okay.  So, it is mainly just the fatigue that you are feeling?"
"15","  Okay, yeah, sounds good.  Is there anything you find that aggravates you feeling tired? Like anything you like, just like you moving around just make you more tired?"
"16","  You okay there?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Alright, do not worry, yeah, I was just curious to know when you feel tired, is it like do you feel tired all the time, do you feel just more tired when you like move around or you know do you feel tired, more tired in the morning?"
"19","  I see okay.  Have you taken anything to help you with that?  Like any sort of supplements or vitamins or just drinking more water?"
"20","  Okay, Alright.  And you have not had any falls or anything like that?"
"21","  No, no falls, okay.  Have you ever felt confused in the past?"
"22","  No, okay, that is good to hear.  Yeah, any numbness that you have in your body, you know, like you cannot feel your toes or fingers or anything like that."
"23","  Okay, okay.  You notice anything else, like, you know, like fever, cough."
"24","   No.  Just feeling tired all the sudden."
"25","   Okay, that is good.  And."
"26","  Yeah, that can be difficult.  Yeah especially, you know, you want to spend time with your grandchildren, so I understand that.  When you feel tired, is it more like as if you like ran a marathon?  Like are you out of breath or are you just more so like fatigue like your muscles."
"27","  Okay, so it is not short of breath."
"28","  Alright.  Looks good.  How is your diabetes right now?  Do you feel like are you taking all your medications on time as directed?"
"29","  Any trouble getting those? "
"30","  Have you, have you had any trouble getting those, how is your insurance, doing okay and everything?"
"31","  That is good to hear.  Do you measure your blood glucose at home?"
"32","  215, okay, that is a little high, right?"
"33","  Yeah, okay.  And how has that been pretty high for the past few months or is that something new?"
"34","  Typical, okay.  When you measure it, do you usually measure it before or after you eat?"
"35","  Okay.  How do you do that after you eat?"
"36","  Okay, no, I am just curious, you know, sometimes we like to get those two numbers."
"37","  Yeah.  I did not make sure when you grabbed it because it changes how we look at those numbers. "
"38","  Okay. So, let me see.  You are taking your metformin and glipizide, which is good.  And you do not take any statins, do you?"
"39","  No. Okay.  Any other medications you are taking right now besides these?"
"40","  Okay.  And do you have any allergies to any medications?"
"41","  No, okay.  And I am want curious about your family.  Did anyone in your family have diabetes?"
"42","  Okay.  And do you know if that was type I or type 2?"
"43","  Type 2, okay, anyone else? Cousins"
"44","  What about any other family illnesses like cardiovascular disease?  Any autoimmune diseases?"
"45","  No, okay.  And what about in your childhood? Did you have any diseases growing up in your childhood?"
"46","  Yeah."
"47","  Hmm Hmm.  All right.  Yeah. So I am looking at some of your labs here, especially the A1c  and it looks like over the past two years, it has been going up starting from a 6.9 to 7.9.  I know that it was telling us is that is a really high, really consistently high blood sugar which obviously is not a good thing and maybe contributing to some of the fatigue you are experiencing."
"48","  Yeah, 7.4 a year ago, but now like some of the labs are looking a bit higher. "
"49","  Yeah, especially with what you are telling me right now that you are seeing a blood glucose in the 200s before eating, that is a bit concern.  That can be a bit concerning. "
"50","  It is still below 8, yes. "
"51","  But you know, the lower the better and always want to mitigate that risk and, you know, make sure you are feeling well.  So I think I have everything I need.  Umm.  Yeah, I am going to go talk with my doctor and I think from what it looks like maybe that the metformin and glipizide is just not enough for you right now and we may need to consider other treatments which could include other medications or even potentially insulin."
"52","  but, you know, because this is type 2 diabetes, we can always work with you trying to avoid that, you know, the things like weight loss, diet control, you know, preventative care is much better than having to take insulin.  So there are ways you can work around it to whatever works best for you and your family.  So yeah, if you do not have any other questions, I am going to step out and go speak with my attending."
"53","  Yeah and hopefully you will have more energy to spend time with your grandkids."
"54","  Sounds good.  Let me go."
