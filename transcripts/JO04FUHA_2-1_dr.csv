"1","  Hey Tom.  I think you’re still muted, it’s your microphone is off.  No worries, I know it’s frustrating all this technology is horrible, so, just focus on real quicky and I can help you figure this out, okay, it will just take a quick second, sounds good Tom.  So, if you’re on your computer real quick here if you look in the bottom left corner, there is a little microphone, you just have to click that.  There you go."
"2","  That’s okay, I am 25, sir but you know I feel yeah this technology these days is too much sometimes."
"3","  So, Tom I saw that you come in, you wanted to chat today just kind of your general health and then also you’re little worried about COVID?"
"4","  Well, that’s really kind of you and that’s often that she is worrying about yeah too, so, yeah tell me how you’re feeling?"
"5","  How and when did they start?"
"6","  Do you know if you’re exposed to anyone with COVID?"
"7","  That’s a good point.  How many people that you probably work with on a day?"
"8","  Okay, yeah it sounds like a nice ___________ often work outdoor."
"9","  I see that you had cough with a little bit of fever and you’re taking DayQuil, is that been helping you kind of through this or?"
"10","  Okay, so I am curious if you would be interested in getting a COVID test, we could do COVID and flu testing.  You’re still within the range to where if you did have COVID, I am potentially getting you one of the new medications, medication that is in roll out for that could really help with your symptom and fighting the disease.  So, would you be interested in getting a COVID test?"
"11","  Okay, I guess I should ask too, Tom you know if you have been vaccinated for COVID?"
"12","  Have you even vaccinated against the flu, this past year, fall?"
"13","  Okay, yeah and with that do you, I understand, have you just been kind of at home for the past couple of days then?"
"14","  Okay, I am sorry about that.  With that, I am curious then can I share, actually first can I share a little more information with you about the COVID test?"
"15","  So, yeah we could do there is a couple of options, you can do at-home test which involve spitting into a little tube which isn’t as accurate, but you know could work or we could probably send someone to your house and they could swab your nose, take it a test it’s the most accurate and then with that if you are COVID negative that’s great, you’ll probably beat this in a couple of days, if you’re COVID positive, we can work forward to getting you on one of the new COVID medications and then hopefully getting you back to work as soon as possible with that, so, what do you think about that sir?"
"16","  Yeah, I understand that, I do think the central government is still paying for COVID testing and so I am not too worried about that and it will not be billed to your insurance, what do you think of that?"
"17","  Just like a longer Q-tip, it’s over and like a second, it’s really quick."
"18","  Perfect and then so I am happy to work through that, is there anything else that’s bothering you sir?"
"19","  Yes, well, that’s awesome, that’s really hurt your girlfriend like I said earlier, seems like she really cares about you and that’s good to have someone care about you so much."
"20","  So I know on telehealth we can do all the steps I do with the physical exam for some of you just came in, but then normally too at our first appointment we take some labs but since you’re currently sick, we can’t really take those labs now wouldn’t really give us results that show where you are at baseline and so we’re probably going to put some orders for just some wellness labs for you and that’s just going to check your blood levels to see if you have any anemias, if you’re low on iron, if you’re low on any nutrient and that’s something you can just come to that clinic when you’re healthy and get your blood drawn sort of that and then we’re just kind of, I’ll just kind of go through some other history stuff if that’s okay with you just to kind of see throughout any risk for any illnesses or anything."
"21","  I guess at baseline do you notice any okay we’ll probably have to do a lot of it, just another for check up in the future but do you know if you have any family history of diabetes?"
"22","  Any family history of heart disease?"
"23","  Any family history of cancer?"
"24","  What, is she doing okay?"
"25","  And then I guess just some other couple of symptoms will just kind of go through and if anything I’ll just ask you handful of questions and if anything kind of popped here just, you can feel free to chat, have you noticed any fatigue recently other than associated with your illness?"
"26","  So, any weight change?"
"27","  Any difficulty breathing on exertion?"
"28","  Any heart pain, chest pain?"
"29","  Any do you ever get any cramping in your legs when you walk around?"
"30","  Have you noticed increase in going to the bathroom or ever feeling thirsty?"
"31","  Anything, okay, good to know.  Any changes in your bowel habit?"
"32","  Okay.  Do you know if you, do you bruise easily?"
"33","  Cool and then now I am just kind of go over some health behaviors as we do this with all our patients.  So, I like one I mentioned in exercise earlier, are you able to exercise?"
"34","  That’s awesome and then what do you eat if you could describe what you eat the meal like you know one day just go through that?"
"35","  How about dinner?"
"36","  Okay, and then yeah getting into alcohol, do you drink alcohol then?"
"37","  How many days a week would you say you drink two to three beers?"
"38","  And how many days a week do you think you drink more than five beers?"
"39","  Okay. When do you like to drink beer?"
"40","  Do you like doing it in social aspects to then or is it usually by yourself or?"
"41","  How many beers do you drink?"
"42","  Do you drink other alcohols or liquor or only beer?"
"43","  Do you mind if I share you some information about drinking?"
"44","  And it’s great, a red flag for us if someone drink more than five beers a day and I think it’s great that you’re not doing that.  So, I guess it’s okay to do if you do it in social aspect every so often, there is nothing wrong with that.  I am a little worried about you though Tom drinking two to three beers a day can be a little hard on your body, what do you think about, sir?"
"45","  Do you just drink at dinnertime then?"
"46"," In the past years, have you ever shown up to work under the influence?"
"47","  Or has it ever been of difficulty with work?"
"48","  Okay and then well I guess as I was talking about earlier we’re going to do some labs, some of those labs we are going to check your liver function.  I think you’ll probably be fine but I think you and me just keeping a strong relationship and just kind of watching your liver and seeing if anything in the future changes then maybe we’ll have another conservation about that but I think you’re doing okay right now, does that sound good to you, Tom?"
"49","  Perfect, do you use any recreational drugs?"
"50","  Any prescription drugs for ________ reason?"
"51","  Perfect and Tom a couple of final questions here, do you know if you had a screening colonoscopy?"
"52","  So, it’s a procedure that everyone gets around 55 and it involves them putting a camera up into your colon to just kind of check for polyps which are basically precancerous lesions, it’s a preventive screening that we do for people and based on your age, we recommend that they get one, would you be interested in scheduling an appointment for that?"
"53","  It does sound pretty intense?"
"54","  You will be knocked out, we can also talk about this or I get now there is probably something I would as you’re kind of provider somehow recommend that we schedule for yeah.  You will be knocked out, you won’t remember any of it and I think it’s really good and preventative for your health."
"55","  Okay, yeah keep that in mind.  So, Tom today we kind of went over how your partner thinks you might have COVID, you think you might have a small cold but we did agree to have send someone over to do a quick COVID test for yeah and then potentially put you on some medications for that if that’s positive.  We are also putting in some wellness labs to check for you just to check for anemias, check to make sure you got good ____________ and your liver is doing good, your kidneys are doing good, no risk factors for diabetes or anything and then potentially talk with you again about on scheduling that colonoscopy, is there any questions do you have for me or anything else we would like to chat about there?"
"56","  So, is there anything else you wanted to mention?"
"57","  Okay, well thank you very much."
"58","  Okay, you could have pain there, you could start having something called jaundice which is where your liver is not the best to doing its job anymore and so your skin would turn a little bit yellow, have you ever noticed?"
"59","  Your skin turning yellow or pain in your abdomen?"
"60","  Well, good to know.  Well, thank you, Tom I don’t have any other questions for you.  So, I am putting those orders and have someone come over to your house to test you for COVID?"
"61","  Thank you very much, sir."
"62","  Take care, okay."
"63","  Good luck."
