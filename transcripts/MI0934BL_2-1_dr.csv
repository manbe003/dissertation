"1","  Hello."
"2","  Hi, can you hear me alright?  Hi Tom.  My name is Leah.  I am going to be working with you today and just kind of see what is going on and see what we can do to help you."
"3","  How are you doing today?"
"4","  Okay."
"5","  You are not interested? but okay, well, thank you first for still being here.  It sounds like you have been having a cough with and you have not been feeling overall too well with a fever."
"6","  Have you measured it, your temperature?"
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Not very warm. Okay, how long has this been going on for?"
"9","  So, a few days."
"10","  Has it, have you been going to work or anything?"
"11","  You have been off so far. What has your energy level been?"
"12","  Hmm."
"13","  Hmm.  So you, but you have also had a cough?"
"14","  Cough.  Do you have any runny nose?"
"15","  Any difficulty breathing?"
"16","  Okay.  How about when you walk, do you have any difficulty breathing?"
"17","  Is this how you generally feel when you have a cold?"
"18","  Hmm.  Have you been exposed to anybody who has been sick?"
"19","  You do not know.  How has your appetite been?"
"20","  How much have you been eating?"
"21","  Very good.  Have you had any changes to how to tasting things or smelling things?"
"22","  Hm, hm, okay."
"23","  Well, COVID, sometimes it does have the classic symptom of, you know, no taste or smell, but sometimes it does not present with that or it presents with that later on.  So unfortunately, that is yeah.  Yeah, unfortunately that is not a way to exclude it, but it would be a nice way to exclude it.  Have you noticed any other symptoms? Any headaches?"
"24","  Dizziness or lightheadedness?   Umm.  Who do you live with currently?"
"25","  Your girlfriend, so you have just kind of been in the home, has she been sick?"
"26","  No.  She is fine.  Okay.  And you mentioned that you do not necessarily want to come in for a COVID test."
"27","  Sorry, I did not catch that."
"28","  You are not resisting it."
"29","  Hmm.  Do you have any, at-home COVID tests or any?"
"30","  Yeah, because I think."
"31","  Yeah.  Well, it definitely would be, I mean if you do not necessarily want to come in here, there is another option to get COVID tested with a home test."
"32","  Yeah.  But if you do want to come in and get a COVID test, we have locations that are doing it more remotely, so you can get it through like a pharmacy where you drive in and you do not have to come in and see people and expose people.  Is there any specific way you would prefer to do it?"
"33","  That would be fine.  Would it be okay to ask the medical assistant to schedule you for a test? "
"34","  Okay.  So if you are feeling fine, that is, that is a good sign.  But if your symptoms do worsen, we can talk more about that or you can go to the hospital to get that evaluated.  But if you are feeling overall fine, just what you have been doing, resting, hydrating, eating is, is a very great way to treat this.  Have you been taking any medication?"
"35","  DayQuil.  Has that been helping?"
"36","  Okay.  Yeah, we are continuing with that.  And if your temperature does increase, taking Tylenol to decrease it would also be another good option."
"37","  Do you have any questions for me?"
"38","  Yeah, just watching out for if your symptoms are worsening.  So if you are getting short of breath, you are noticing that.  It is difficult to breathe or you are getting chest pain or just something that is very unusual for a cold, you know, besides having a runny nose and a cough, but if your symptoms are progressing to the point where they are getting severe, that is, would be a reason to go to the hospital."
"39","  Okay.  Any other questions?"
"40","  Well, I am really sorry that you are feeling poorly, but if you are able to take time off, work, and rest and do what you are doing. I think you are going to be on the right track to getting better."
"41","  Okay.  Thank you for seeing us today."
"42","  Thank you.  Bye, bye."
