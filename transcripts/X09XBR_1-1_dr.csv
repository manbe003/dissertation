"1","  Hi, Tom, I think you are still muted.  Are you able to unmute yourself in the left hand corner of your screen?  Can you hear me?"
"2","  Hi."
"3","  How’re you doing?"
"4","  Do you like to be called Tom?"
"5","  Yeah, my name is Tiniya, I am one of the student doctors here."
"6","  It’s nice to meet you."
"7","  I can see that you are feeling a little off, is that a correct assumption?"
"8","  Tell me a little more about what you’re feeling?"
"9","  Hmm.   When you say cold, what do you mean, what are your symptoms?"
"10","  Okay and a week ago you were just fine doing what you enjoy and not having any issues."
"11","  Okay.  Have you taken your temperature at home?"
"12","  Okay.  Any cough?"
"13","  Okay.  Do you feel that the cough is a lot, is there a lot of phlegm with that cough, lot of stuff that comes up?"
"14","  Okay.  Do you notice if it’s a color like yellow, green, any unusual colors?"
"15","  And then I see that you have a little handkerchief with you."
"16","  Anybody else at home sick?"
"17","  Okay, so just you."
"18","  You live with anyone?"
"19","  Okay.  Any children or exposures to children like daycares or occupations that expose you to children?"
"20","  Okay.  Have you had symptoms like this before in the past?"
"21","  So, it’s been a long time since you’ve had what you think is kind of like cold type symptoms."
"22","  Is there anything unusual about this last week of symptoms that prompted you to make this visit today?"
"23","  Yeah, that concerns me as well.  Do you mind if I ask some few more questions?"
"24","  Have you lost your sense of smell?"
"25","  Okay.  Do you drink coffee in the morning?"
"26","  You still smell that coffee pretty strongly when you make it."
"27","  Okay, great and have you had any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?"
"28","  Okay but nothing worse than what your baseline is prior to a week ago."
"29","  Okay, any exposures to COVID that you know of?"
"30","  Okay.  How easy is it for you to access transportation to a clinic or COVID drive-through site?"
"31","  Okay.  So you have transportation and that’s reliable for you to get somewhere?"
"32","  Great.  I think that your girlfriend is very smart to get you a visit especially with all the COVID stuff going around.  From what you tell me, I think that you might have either a viral infection like the common cold that comes around this time of year, but I also don’t want to miss COVID especially since that’s something that you could potentially pass onto other people around you including your girlfriend.  So, if it’s okay with you, I think my plan would be to have you go and get tested for COVID, is that something that you would be able to do?"
"33","  Okay.  Are you taking anything for symptom management right now?"
"34","  Okay, I mean like cough syrups, Tylenol, ibuprofen anything like that?"
"35","  Okay.  I think first steps first, let’s get you tested for COVID.  I can email you some or I can let you know some instructions for that.  You shouldn’t expect results and result should take about 24 to 48 hours.  In the meantime, I recommend if you have a fever or feel feverish, you can go ahead and take the Tylenol, an over-the-counter Tylenol for that."
"36","  If you want, some people don’t like feeling feverish and so they want to treat it, that’s something that you can do if you want to, but it’s not necessary to do."
"37","  Okay and then once that COVID results come back hopefully they are negative and if they are then we can see if the symptoms get better in the next week or so and if they do, then most likely common cold, if not, we should work you up for some other things."
"38","  How does that sound?"
"39","  Okay.  Is there anything else that I can do for you today?"
"40","  Okay.  I do have a few more questions to ask you just to make sure that I have a good medical history for you, is that okay?"
"41","  Do you have any history of heart disease or been diagnosed with disease."
"42","  With heart disease?"
"43","  Okay, any history of asthma or lung disease?"
"44","  Okay and then any medications that you take on a daily basis right now?"
"45","  Okay and do you smoke sir?"
"46","  Okay and do you drink alcohol?"
"47","  Okay, okay.  That all sounds good.  So, I will go ahead and send you some instructions for how to get tested for COVID, if your results do come back negative, you are eligible for the COVID vaccine."
"48","  Is that something that has been you’ve heard about, been talked to about or interested in learning more about?"
"49","  Yeah.  Tell me first, tell me a little bit more about what you know about it?"
"50","  Yeah.  So, the COVID vaccine protects people from essentially being hospitalized from severe complications from COVID and we do recommend it for people over 50 because your risk of being hospitalized because of COVID increased with age.  There are a lot of vaccination sites that we can get you lined up with to get the vaccine if that’s something that you would like to do."
"51","  Okay.  The one requirement is that you can have a diagnosis of COVID within 90 days of getting the vaccine.  So, we’ll wait until the results from the COVID drive-through test comes back before we set this up."
"52","  Okay.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
"53","  Okay, well, it’s nice meeting you sir."
"54","  I hope you feel better."
"55","  Okay.  So, now I just raise my hand."
