"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Yeah, if I’ve got all the buttons pushed, I think so."
"3","  I’ve felt better but not too bad."
"4","  Well I don’t know, I just been feeling really tired, I am a little bit overheated. "
"5","  Basically, I think I have a cold but my girlfriend told me that I need to come in and I have a what you call it, a general exam anyway and I might as well get tested for COVID while I am here."
"6","  I don’t go to the doctor much.  I haven’t been to the doctor in 10 years so at least so."
"7","  Okay."
"8","  I don’t know, I just felt kind of warm off and on since I cut this, how can I put it, well, I used to have a thermometer but I think my ex took it and so I don’t have one right now, I was going to measure my temperature and stuff."
"9","  But so I don’t know how hot I am. "
"10","  Maybe a little bit but that’s more the weather I think because it is changing."
"11","  No."
"12","  Well, except that my nose is clogged up and it sometimes makes me cough a little bit but it is not bothering."
"13","  No, I just caught a cold I think but."
"14","  That’s right, I think it is, I think basically Emily just started freaking out because I haven’t got shots and she got one of her shots."
"15","  And she wants me to get shots and I don’t really care, I don’t think it is – well anyway I don’t want to get into that but."
"16","  Yes, one of the things that the basic thing that I wanted to arrange I don’t know it’s you see on TV how hard it is to get tested or to get shots and stuff."
"17","  I am busy, I work construction and we get up early and by the time everybody else is gone we’re already called it a day so, I don’t know."
"18","  No, that’s been as earlier as this week probably Monday maybe I was kind of tired on the weekend but it’s really started feeling stuffed up."
"19","  And a little bit a cough on Monday."
"20","  Yeah, we wear masks but when we’re working and when there isn’t anybody around you don’t have to wear them all the time but most people go along with the program, it’s not that big a deal but when you are working hard it’s hard to breathe when you’ve got a cold."
"21","  No, I don’t think so."
"22","  Ahhh, I…"
"23","  Yeah, I didn’t know how to get started there, yeah, a few changes, got married, got divorced that’s the last 10 years yeah but I’ve been the same person now since about 2016, I think it is."
"24","  So about four and five years."
"25","  I have been taking DayQuil and NyQuil and they seem to make a little bit of a difference, specially at night I can sleep a little bit better with those."
"26","  I am sorry?"
"27","  Well for about the last three or four days I have."
"28","  Oh, no."
"29","  No."
"30","  No."
"31","  I like to drink beers."
"32","  I’ll have a few beers in the evening after dinner or with dinner."
"33","  Yeah."
"34","  I don’t recall and generally told me to eat healthy foods and get lots of exercise so, but I don’t remember any specific problem or stuff or you know..."
"35","  Not that I know of, no."
"36","  Do I have to do a bunch of labs and stuff?  I was wondering how you are going to do this online here."
"37","  No, no."
"38","  Just one moment while I tell the computer not to, oh, oh."
"39","  It wants to restart this computer for some reason, it says pick a time."
"40","  There is but they are grey and so, it is just pick a time and there is no…"
"41","  Well that would be nice and there is no minimized thing here, let’s see if I can go back to the, good let’s get, there I go."
"42","  How is that?"
"43","  If all of a sudden, the computer just turns off in the middle of what we’re doing it means that Microsoft has taken over."
"44","  I guess we covered most of the basis as long as I can tell Emily that I am going to get a COVID test and get some kind of general exam, that’s what she wants me to do so."
"45","  Yes, that sounds like a good idea."
"46","  I would go along with."
"47","  That’s okay.  I am still hoping that this computer doesn’t just suddenly decide to go off on its own. "
