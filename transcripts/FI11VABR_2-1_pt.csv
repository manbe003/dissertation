"1","  No."
"2","  Yes I think I got it, yes I got it twice as this, what you call these touching mouse things, touch pads, yeah they, it’s drives me crazy trying to make them move around.  They are real…"
"3","  Pretty good, kind of tired, but feeling okay I guess."
"4","  Well, I don’t know.  I know I am supposed to check on my diabetes every four months or so, but I think it has been about a year since I have actually checked on it.  So I figured that I come on in you know get the, I am not in there, but how do you say, you know do this video call here to get to figure out how we are doing and everything."
"5","  Oh yeah, for sure."
"6","  COVID mostly, and then I don’t know, you just get busy, you get wrapped up with, I got work, and then I get home and while my wife takes care of my grandkids most of the time during the day when the kids are at work, but I really enjoy when I get home I get to kind of take over for a while, while she cooks dinner and you know, one of the things that concerns me is I like spending time with my grandkids, and I just sort of run out of energy.  By the time I get there sometimes, I am just ready for a nap instead of playtime."
"7","  Oh they are full of energy, no matter what you do."
"8","  Yeah, that sounds good to me, thanks."
"9","  That sounds good.  Actually you sound kind of like one of my grandkids.  So, she is 8-year old, is always in charge."
"10","  She wants to beat the mom."
"11","  The 5-year-old though wants to be the 8-year-old. "
"12","  Well, my feet get tired, I guess from when I am on them a lot, but mostly it’s just sort of a general feeling of tiredness, since they put me on those what you call them, diabetes drugs, I haven’t had too much of that foot pain, so I am figuring that that is why we are making good progress."
"13","  So I don’t know if I needed to up the dose of those or if you know the, what you call, glipizide and metformin."
"14","  Maybe we can just sort of raise those a little bit."
"15","  No, I don’t usually go around barefoot, so I don’t know."
"16","  I don’t know, but as far as I know, they are doing okay for….."
"17","  They are more like muscle ache, I just feel tired when I stand or if I have got a lot of things to do and…"
"18","  So it’s more like depending on what activity I am going through.  But, I have been trying to get more exercise.  I have been going, doing more rounds and that and doing maybe a walk or two during the week if I can."
"19","  Alright, that sounds good."
"20","  Oh, my mom has diabetes.  She is 75 now, so going to my dad passed away in 2019, natural causes I guess, I don’t know."
"21","  But that’s about, that’s all I can think of my mom."
"22","  Oh, type 2, yeah, same…."
"23","  No, pretty much I try to limit myself to that, yeah."
"24","  Hmm…no."
"25","  Okay."
"26","  No."
"27","  No."
"28","  No."
"29","  ______."
"30","  No."
"31","  No."
"32","  No, I mean you know I have had colds and things and stuff over the year, but nothing is bothering me now."
"33","  No."
"34","  No."
"35","  I just feel like kind of fatigue.  I don’t know if it’s a weakness, but..."
"36","  Feeling tired."
"37","  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean I am right-handed, so it’s a little bit different, but…"
"38","  No, no, fortunate that way, yeah."
"39","  Oh I don’t know what all that entails.  I don’t know.  I haven’t seen the…"
"40","  Don't they do those tests to find out, are ______?"
"41","  Did that go off or did it…?"
"42","  All good, okay."
"43","  Um, well, that’s one of the reasons, one of the reasons I came in because I wanted to see if there is another provider I could talk to, I mean another, find another doctor because the last one was really almost offensive, because I mean it’s like I eat pretty good food and everything and she used to tell me I couldn’t eat fried chicken on the weekend.  And you know the family gets together on a Sunday, we have fried chicken as just part of the meal, but like I can change my meds and stuff, but I don’t know what I am going to do about…"
"44","  Yeah."
"45","  Oh yeah, I get, all that’s taken are of with my insurance."
"46","  Well, Premera Blue Cross, I guess Mirabella Company is for that.  So that’s what I get."
"47","  What is a PCP?"
"48","  Oh, oh, that’s like you, doctor."
"49","  Oh okay."
"50","  You let old people abbreviations and it’s like watch young people who’re texting nowadays and they can spell out a whole book in about 10 minutes, so it’s just what ____."
"51","  Yeah."
"52","  I feel safe you know."
"53","  Oh, no."
"54","  Sure I can start out with a good breakfast and you usually have to get lunch on the go, but then my wife is a great cook, she makes healthy dinner for me.  So you know, pretty good about my diet most of the time."
"55","  Well I started with some coffee and a little cream and sugar of course, but then eggs you know for the protein."
"56","  Then hash browns maybe with butter on them, but anyway pretty hardy breakfast, so it gives me the energy to get going and for lunch though I am usually on the go.  So I go buy McDonalds if I am really hungry, double cheese burger and some fries and probably a large coke, and that will see me through the afternoon. "
"57","  Oh yeah, for dinner, my wife is a great cook and so she is usually going to cook me something like steak and potatoes, different kinds of steak, we just make potatoes in general, but oh and usually I have a bowl of ice cream for dessert, that will, so did I mention I sometimes have probably use the coke along with that with dinner I mean not with the ice cream, I know, it is just bad but usually ice cream just for dessert you know and the cokes is for dinnertime."
"58","  I don’t know if it would be hours at a time.  You know, I usually walk around the facility, make 10 or 15-minute walks a lot of the time during the week."
"59","  And if the weather is nice, you know maybe I can get out now, do a walk up one of the parks, something on the weekend get my wife to go along with me and…"
"60","  There are some nice parks in our area.  Have you ever been down to Kubota Garden that’s just south of us in Columbia City and anyway it’s just beautiful gardens down there, but we never get to go there too often, but once in a while."
"61","  Well, let us see.  So of course down by the water too you know _____ lake, so…"
"62","  Social life, I mean oh we have a social life at work, I mean no people I work with and our clients and everything that’s they do not have like social relations.  I am a homecare administrator, I help supervise our downtown facilities, so not really is a social event there.  Well, I guess my family is my main social activity, and I told you about my grandkids."
"63","  And, but my kids are both, so she is about 30s and his 20s, so they are both working and they are you know staying out of trouble and I get to, and I see my daughter more because of the kids, the grandkids, but I don’t see my son that much, he is usually too busy you know.  He has got so many things to do."
"64","  But my wife really enjoys the grandkids too, and together I think we saved our daughter a lot of babysitting money over the years."
"65","  It is indeed exercise just trying to keep up with them."
"66","  Okay, it sounds good."
"67","  Sorry, I am just connecting my feet and my eyes together here and it has got…"
"68","  I don’t really understand it too well.  I understand that it kind of puts your body on the whack and you need to get yourself back and balance again and that’s kind of where they start the metformin and glipizide were doing because I don’t feel those big energy loss episodes that I used to have."
"69","  And I guess my feet are better I don’t get so much of that foot pain as I did years and years ago, although when I get real tired now, it is a good reminder I suppose."
"70","  Yeah, oh I guess so, it, the main thing I am concerned about is I don’t want to end up on insulin and, but you know, there are things in my situation I can’t really change.  I mean my wife is a cook and she, you never argue with a cook that’s not good.  But, I can get more exercise and metformin, glipizide, stuff like that if I keep taking those that, I would like to keep that in balance too."
"71","  Yeah, that’s for sure."
"72","  Yeah, I can talk to somebody about that.  That would be fine you know."
"73","  I know I will have to talk to…"
"74","  I will talk to Louise about that and see what she thinks, but I don’t know what kind of oil she uses."
"75","  But I don’t know, but I just like what’s you know, good and easy and fast and generally, I mean.  Suppose Coca-Cola is not a good habit I can maybe talk to somebody about that."
"76","  Oh no, I have tried that bubbly water and it turns your tongue black, so I don’t like that stuff at all.  It tastes terrible too."
"77","  Yeah."
"78","  Yeah, that will be fun to see."
"79","  If somebody tell her what to do."
"80","  Yeah."
"81","  Yeah, I don’t know, hope you are not causing trouble here."
"82","  I guess so, it sounds good, yeah."
"83","  I don’t know, I just sometimes am I just really tired or am I just getting to be an old guy, it’s about ready to check out or, anyway I guess I will just wait and talk to the next doctor about that and…"
"84","  Well, I don’t know.  In the meantime, what is it that I am supposed to do?"
"85","  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  It has been a year, so yeah, I will be much better about that, I will get you know another what is it four months or so and…"
"86","  Okay, yeah, that makes sense."
"87","  Sounds great, well thanks for your help."
"88","  Oh alright and thanks a lot."
"89","  You too."
"90","  Do I, I don’t know how I…"
"91","  I finished this here, what do I do next?"
"92","  Dots."
"93","  Oh here it is when I moved this mouse thing the whole bottom of things gave me a bunch of things to, first the…"
"94","  Oh yes, that will work."
