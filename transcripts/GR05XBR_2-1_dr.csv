"1","  Hi, there."
"2","  Good.  How are you?"
"3","  So, my name is Alley Alverson, I am a third-year medical student.  So, I am just going to ask you some questions and see if I can help you out today."
"4","  Great.  So, you must be Freddie?"
"5","  Alright.  Is that what you like to go by?"
"6","  Okay, sounds good.  So, I saw that you are here for a checkup on your diabetes, is that right?"
"7","  Okay.  So, tell me how things have been going?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay.  When did that start for you?"
"10","  Okay and how did you notice it?"
"11","  Okay.  Does it feel like you’re like sleepy or just like kind of hard to like not having the same like endurance you used to?"
"12","  Okay, alright.  So, you have been feeling a little bit you know fatigued and feeling kind of like you don’t have the same endurance you used to for the past couple of weeks."
"13","  Yeah, so tell me more about like, has anything changed that you think might be causing this?"
"14","  Okay, alright.  Are you still able to like walk the same distance you used to?"
"15","  Okay, great and you said you are not sure if this is just related to maybe getting older or maybe the diabetes?"
"16","  Okay.  Does anything make you better or worse?"
"17","  Sleep helps.  Have you noticed any other symptoms kind of seem to be going on at the same time as this?"
"18","  Okay.  So, you’re peeing more than you used to?"
"19","  Okay and when you’re peeing more, is it a larger volume of pee or just more often?"
"20","  Okay.  How is the volume compared to what’s normal for you?"
"21","  Okay.  So, more often a little bit more pee when you’re peeing?"
"22","  Okay, alright and what about feeling really thirsty?"
"23","  Okay and really hungry like more than usual?"
"24","  Okay, okay.  Have you noticed any like swelling in your feet or ankles after you’ve been standing for a while?"
"25","  Okay, okay, so no swelling.  What about your vision, how is that?"
"26","  Okay.  No changes?"
"27","  Okay.  Do you go to the eye doctor?"
"28","  Okay, alright.  So, sometimes with diabetes we worry about sometimes that your blood sugars not under super good control, it can cause damage to your eyes.  So, what we would love is that from all patients with diabetes got eye checks once a year.  Is that something, have you ever had an eye check before?"
"29","  Okay, sounds good.  Do you think you would be able to go and get one?"
"30","  Okay.  Sounds good and other things we worry about is like having kind of that numbness or tingling in your feet or your hands, have you had any of that?"
"31","  Okay, sounds good.  So, sounds like you know none of that recently, no problems with like balance because your feet feel numb?"
"32","  Okay.  Do you check your feet every so often?"
"33","  Okay and any problems with like wounds that aren’t healing on your feet?"
"34","  Okay, alright and how about, how is your diet and exercise been?"
"35","  Great.  So, 15 to 20 minutes a couple of times a week?"
"36","  Okay and how is your diet?"
"37","  Okay, alright, any major changes to your diet recently?"
"38","  Okay.  Have you and your wife like ever met with a nutritionist that has talked to you about like what foods are kind of good for diabetes and what aren’t?"
"39","  Okay, would that be something you are interested in, sometimes that can help to kind of know what foods are worst for blood sugar and which are good for blood sugar?"
"40","  Okay, yeah, super fair."
"41","  Yeah, it sounds like she is cooking lots of very delicious meals."
"42","  Alright, so yeah, if you could just talk to her about that we can kind of touch base on it next time?"
"43","  Sounds good, okay.  Yeah so, we think about like kind of limiting sugar and kind of carbohydrates.  So, anything you can limit in your diet to kind of cut back on those is definitely going to help the blood sugar a little bit, okay.  So, I have been kind of looking at your A1c over the past few years.  Now, looks like it’s been kind of creeping up a little bit?"
"44","  Yeah."
"45","  Okay and it looks you’re on the metformin 500 mg twice a day and the glipizide 10 mg twice a day, is that right?"
"46","  And do you take those every day?"
"47","  Okay, sounds good.  So, it sounds like for the most part you take them pretty consistently?"
"48","  Okay.  So, a couple of things we can talk about is you know our goal for your A1c those numbers to check your diabetes is we would want it a little bit lower than it is now, we kind of wanted below 7 or up 7 and the most recent one I saw for you was in 2021 and it was 7.9.  So, there is a couple of different options we can do or talk about and see which one you want to move forward with.  We could increase the dose of that metformin and see if that’s able to get your blood sugar down a little bit or we could kind of looking to the other medication with glipizide to see if there is room to go up on that, I would just need to double-check that or we can focus on diet and kind of cutting out some of the sugar and carbohydrates in your diet and see if that helps."
"49","  Yeah, so what are your thoughts?"
"50","  Okay, yeah that sounds good.  So, we can go up to double up the metformin that’s the one it’s 500 mg twice a day and you take it most.  So, we can actually double that dose but we can do it a little bit gradually.  So, at first you can take two with your first dose, two of the 500s and then keep the later one in the day the same.  So, you will be at 1000 with the first dose and then 500 and we can do that for a couple of weeks and if you’re doing okay, we can increase to two for both of them."
"51","  Yeah.  Does that sound like a good plan?"
"52","  Okay and also another thing is exercise is great for blood sugar.  So, even if like you are able to just go on one more walk a week that would do a good thing for your blood sugar control too."
"53","  So, if you are able to do that, that’s great.  I think going up on the medicine is a good idea.  So, we’ll go ahead and recheck that A1c in like three months, how does that sound?"
"54","  Okay, sounds good.  Yeah and about your fatigue, I am just trying to think if that would be completely related to your diabetes and I think it would be reasonable to see if you kind of start to feel better with the increased medicine and if you don’t or you start to feel worse, we definitely want you to come back and we can try looking into other things?"
"55","  Sounds good and just because you have been having that increased urination, we’re going to want to do a couple of urine labs and blood work just to make sure that there isn’t something we should worry about going on."
"56","  Yeah.  So, we’ll have, we’ll want to check to make sure you don’t have like a urinary tract infection or like a bladder infection.  So, we’ll have you leave a urine sample and then we’ll want to check your creatinine, which is a blood test to see how your kidneys are functioning."
"57","  Is there a lab that’s nearby to you that I can order those tests to?"
"58","  Okay, are you okay with getting those labs done in the next couple of weeks?"
"59","  Okay, sounds good.  Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
"60","  Okay, yeah.  So, our plan going forward is we’re going to do those lab tests in the next couple of weeks and why don’t you look for the lab that’s closest to you and do you have access to the MyChart where you can send me messages?"
"61","  Okay, so why don’t you just find out, which one would be the best for you and just send me a message on MyChart and I can order those tests to the spot that’s best for you."
"62","  And then we’ll plan on increasing the metformin to 1000 and then 500 later in the day for a couple of weeks and if you’re doing okay with that, we’ll increase to the 1000 twice a day."
"63","  Sounds good and if you have any problems with diarrhea with the metformin, let me know right away."
"64","  Alright.  And then we’ll see you back in three months and we’ll have you do that repeat A1c around then."
"65","  Sounds good, alright.  Anything else you want to chat about today?"
"66","  Okay, well so good to meet you and I am looking forward to our visit in a few months."
"67","  Thank you.  Have a good one."
