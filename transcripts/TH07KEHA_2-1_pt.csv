"1","  Hello there."
"2","  Doing okay.  How about you?"
"3","  I like pronouns that are useful when you don’t know the noun or if you want to refer the noun without a name in it."
"4","  Well, I know I’m supposed to come in every four months or so and have a check on my diabetes, but I haven’t been here for about a year so, you know, I want to take care of my health.  Here I am."
"5","  I'm sorry?"
"6","  Oh, you know.  Just, you get busy and you just put things off and what with the pandemic and everything, it’s kind of hard to get motivated sometimes."
"7","  Well, the main thing is, I'm just so tired when I get off work, I get home, my wife takes care of our grandkids when our kids are working of course and so, during the day she takes care of them.  When I get home from work, I'm the one who gets to take care of them and lately, I just haven’t had much energy to deal with them, and you know, grandkids are one of the joys in my life, so I want to be able to keep playing with them, but I'm just running out of steam, I guess."
"8","  Oh, I would say at least the last few months, you know, it’s I have just been getting more and more tired, I guess."
"9","  I don't know.  It’s like, in the afternoons especially I just kind of run out of steam and then by the time I get home, I'm just really tired."
"10","  I don't know.  I’ve given that a lot of thought and I don’t know, I’m just not sure, you know."
"11","  Okay, yeah."
"12","  Well, I keep track of my numbers on my blood glucose.  I check that a couple of times a week and so I don’t have that here at the office.  It’s at home.  So yeah, I do keep track of things that way."
"13","  Okay, yeah, sounds good."
"14","  This morning, it was about 215s and maybe it is a little bit high, it is usually around 200."
"15","  Yeah, I wish I had brought that log in with me.  I just didn’t think about it, I just needed to, you know, use the computer here for the conference but I or I can bring that in the next time."
"16","  Hmmm..not that I could put my finger on, I guess, I just I mean, I take my meds, but I know maybe we could adjust my meds a little bit, give me a little bit more energy or something."
"17","  That's correct, yeah."
"18","  That's right.  I do the metformin, it was 500 mg twice a day and then glipizide is 10 mg once a day."
"19","  The glipizide, yeah.  That's what I thought I was supposed to do."
"20","  Yeah, okay, that would be good.  You want me to start taking twice as much now or?"
"21","  Alright, good, as I understand my numbers are still pretty good.  There are under 8 still, so that's what I am aiming for."
"22","  No, I don’t think so."
"23","  I guess so, sure.  That's what I need to do."
"24","  Will I be able to come in, in the evenings or on the weekends?  I'm working full time, of course.  So, I really will not take the time off if I can avoid that."
"25","  I'm usually there by 9 and out by 5.  Sometimes, I get there early and sometimes I stay late, so…"
"26","  Possibly, I'm working downtown, and I live up in Columbia city.  So, where is the clinic located from us?"
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Well, no, I don't know.  I just wonder am I just getting to be an old guy or am I just about to die, or what's the deal?  It kind of makes you uncertain about things."
"29","  Yeah, my wife, Louisa, is a really good cook, and so I'm just happy to have her cook for me while of course in the morning, she gets me started with some coffee, of course, and then after that, some eggs or maybe hash browns, give me enough energy to you know get going until lunchtime.  Oh yeah, lunch, I try to head off to McDonald's which is nearby and grab a double cheeseburger and a big Coke or something and maybe some fries.  Dinnertime, well, she generally cooks, you know, steak and potatoes, some kind of meat and potatoes and coke to drink you know wash it all down and well, I like to have a bowl of ice cream for dessert usually so I’m kind of well to do that way."
"30","  Usually the vegetables are the potatoes and then of course on the cheese burger you get tomato and lettuce and stuff on that too."
"31","  Uhh.  Yeah, pretty much.  I'm kind of worried because you know, my wife is the cook.  I cannot really argue over it.  I just, in general, I like what’s you know is easy and good and so, one of the reasons that I have been for a while, is I had to change providers.  My last provider was telling me I had to give up fried chicken on the weekend, and I’m saying that it’s like, fried chicken, this is like a family dinner, and we do this every weekend.  I can't be just changing things like that on a whim.  So, I don't know, I can you know modify my meds and stuff, but I’m not sure about what I can do for a diet.  It's kind of like not in my control so much."
"32","  Well, I have been doing more exercise, that’s trying to get a walk once a week if I can and also at work, I’ve been doing a lot more, you know, rounds of the facilities and stuff and that gives me some exercise too.  Then it goes on, when I get home and playing with the grandkids, it gives you exercise whether you want it or not."
"33","  I'm a home healthcare supervisor, administrator work, we do what the Mirabella Facilities Downtown."
"34","  Well, I can try, it’s just a matter of time really."
"35","  Hmm.  Well, I don't know, work schedule is the main thing and then dealing with family issues that takes up much of rest of my time and then transportation back and forth.  For a while there we were trying to you know monitor things more on line, but you know, I gotta be at the facility most days, so, I’m just not sure when I can work those in and I’m doing trying to do one on the weekend but I don’t know if I can do both days on the weekend."
"36","  Okay, yeah, I can try that, that would be good."
"37","  Well, I guess so, I don't know, like there is a Burger King nearby too.  I’d have to check and see what the other possibilities are.  I mean, it is Downtown, so there is lots of things going on.  It’s just really how convenient it is from where we are."
"38","  Being able to get coming back in the time that we have, so anyway, I can check on that and see what the other options are."
"39","  I guess so, I’ll talk to Louise about that and see what she can tell me.  It seems like a possibility, yeah."
"40","  What goal should I set, I don’t know."
"41","  Yeah, yeah, it makes sense, yeah."
"42","  I think, we are talking about changing over from McDonald's to maybe Burger King or one of the other places nearby or may be talking to Louise about me bringing something from home or something."
"43","  I guess so."
"44","  I'll try to get a pizza maybe or I can get pizza by the slice now, yeah, that's good."
"45","  I can check and see, I don’t really eat a lot of salad.  I guess I can try if that's what I need to do."
"46","  Yeah, right."
"47","  Okay, I guess so, I can just picture the 8-year-old telling me what to do, she always wants to be the mom anyway, and the 5-year-old wants to be the 8-year-old and they both want to own the 2-year-old.  Anyway, I'll try and we'll see what happens."
"48","  Oh yeah, that would be good.  Okay, good yeah, thanks."
"49","  Just how are things looking I guess."
"50","  Oh yeah."
"51","  Okay, sounds good."
"52","  Can't think of any, no."
"53","  Okay, well thanks."
"54","  Sounds good."
