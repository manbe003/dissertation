"28","  Okay.  Anything else that you've noticed with this that has been bothersome or like worrisome for you?"
"29","  Okay.  And has that been going on just since this illness started or have you noticed the decreased energy before all of this?"
"30","  Sorry that that was a two-parter.  So do you feel like this decrease in energy you've been having started when this cold started or before the cold started?"
"31","  It started when the cold started?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  Okay, how is your sleep been?"
"33","  Since the cold started?"
"34","  Okay, okay.  Has anything seemed to help it?  Have you taken any over-the-counter medications that have seemed to help?"
"35","  Okay.  Right now, what would you say is your most bothersome symptom, so the thing that's bugging you the most?  Is it the cough?  Is it the congestion.  Is it the feeling tired?"
"36","  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm sorry you've been feeling so crummy the last few days.  It sounds like it's not been fun.  Outside of this are you normally pretty healthy, any other lung problems or anything that had been bothering you before the cold?"
"37","  Okay.  You've never been told you've had asthma or COPD, or anything?"
"38","  Okay, okay, fair enough.  How would you say you feel overall?  Does it feel like there is anything that bothers you kind of chronically that you've been worried about or for the most part you feel okay?"
"39","  Okay.  So, you know, thinking back to before the cold, you haven’t had shortness of breath, chest pain, never had any like loss of consciousness where you pass out suddenly?"

"57","  Okay.  Good to hear.  Yeah, yeah.  And do you chew tobacco?"
"58","  Okay.  And any other drug use, marijuana or cocaine?"
"59","  Okay.  So aside from the fatigue and the cold symptoms you've been having, you know, you mentioned that it has been a while since you've seen a physician, you know, I think we have the opportunity to talk about anything else that you've noticed that you wanted to get addressed at this visit.  Is there anything else that comes to mind that you've been worried about or had questions about?"
"60","  Okay.  That's not an uncommon thing, you know.  There's a lot that's on your mind kind of on a day-to-day basis.  Do you mind if I just ask you kind of a broad list of questions and…?"
"61","  So, first question is, how would you say your mood has been?  Do you ever have times where you feel really anxious or really down?"
"62","  What is it about the news that, is it something that makes you anxious or is it something that makes you feel depressed?"
"63","  The anxious part or the sad part?"
"64","  Okay, what do you typically do as an outlet to kind of get your mind off of everything?"
"65","  Great."
"66","  That sounds awesome.  Sounds like a really good outlet."
"67","  Yeah, that's fair about, yeah.  Well it sounds like you are doing a good job of staying active, so that's great.  That will definitely keep you healthy. "
"68","  Yeah.  What other things do you like to do?"
"69","  Yeah, that's fair enough.  And it sounds like she is pretty worried about you too, having you come in and get seen."
"70","  So, I'm glad you did.  You know, I think it's beneficial to both address sort of what's been going on with you acutely and then also any other health problems.  Have you ever had thoughts of like hurting yourself or hurting others?"
"71","  Okay."
"72","  Okay, okay.  And any headaches, migraines, dizziness?"
"73","  Okay.  And any changes in vision, blurry vision?"
"74","  Okay.  No throat pain, swelling?"
"75","  Okay.  And I think you had mentioned earlier that maybe occasional diarrhea or constipation?"
"76","  Does it ever look really dark like coffee browns?"
"77","  Okay, I know it's a weird question, but that's, so sometimes if you're having some blood loss from your bowel, your stool or the diarrhea will kind of look like coffee brown.  So I know it's a weird question, but that's why we ask it."
"78","  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, and any changes to your urinary habits, so peeing a lot, peeing not enough?"
"79","  Okay.  Does it feel like you're able to empty your bladder completely?"
"80","  Okay, okay.  And any troubles with erectile dysfunction or sexual drive?"
"81","  Okay. And any like, tingling or numbness in your feet?"
"82","  Okay, okay.  And any family history of any sorts of cancers or lung disease?"
"83","  Okay.  Any other cancers as far as you're aware of?"
"84","  Oh, wow!  Okay."
"85","  Okay.  And what about any family history of like high blood pressure or diabetes?"
"86","  Okay.  Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure or diabetes?"
"87","  Okay.  Have you ever been diagnosed with something in the past?  I know you said it's been like over a decade since you saw a physician, but previously were you ever diagnosed with anything or put on medication for anything that you can remember?"
"88","  Yeah, no that's great and like I said it sounds like you've been doing a good job of staying active and kind of keeping up with things.  So yeah, that's great.  Anything else that comes to mind about your health or do you have questions about or wanted to get addressed while we're here?"
"89","  Yeah, so I think, given your presentation, there's a couple of things I would like to do.  So, I think first and foremost, you know, being the world we live in today I think your COVID test is very reasonable just given your symptoms.  The fact that you're having sort of this whitish sputum that you're producing is not something we necessarily think about with COVID and so something else I would like to do is get a chest x-ray and what that would show is if there is anything in your lungs, that like a pneumonia, or something we call pleural effusion, which is basically kind of fluid or puss in the lungs, so I'd like to do that.  And then also just get some general labs just because you haven’t been to a physician so long and will give us kind of a baseline going forward.  If anything does come up then we kind of know where you're sitting at.  I don't think we're necessarily going to find anything different in the labs, but I think it will be helpful for us to have.  And then obviously the COVID test and then the chest x-ray will kind of help us determine is this something that is viral, so COVID or just another viral respiratory infection or is it something that's more bacterial like in pneumonia that we could give you some pills to treat.  Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?"
"90","  What insurance do you currently have?"
"91","  Okay. And what do you -- I don't think they ______, are you working right now?"
"92","  Okay.  What kind of construction?"
"93","  And you're not like installing like insulation, or like or do you?"
"94","  Okay, okay.  And then any like sandblasting or like things with minerals or working in mining?"
"95","  Okay, okay.  Well, I think that, and that do you feel like your symptoms recently have been impeding your ability to do your job?"
"96","  Yeah."
"97","  Yeah, we can send you, so there are a couple of options.  So for the COVID test you can get them sort of all over the city there are drive up ones, also come into the clinic and we can do one for you here.  We also have the blood draw capabilities here.  So it would be easier for you and you have okay transportation we could have you come here and have that done and then do the bloodwork and the chest x-ray I was talking about as well.  And typically, with the insurance you have, typically those things are all covered with insurance."
"98","  So for the COVID testing, yes.  I will have to check in the labs or the chest x-ray.  If not, we can refer it to one of the hospitals here and they can usually do both of those things regardless of during the week."
"99","  Yeah, or evenings, you're definitely not alone in terms of being in that boat of not being able to come during working hours.  So if we can't do it at the clinic then certainly we will be able to set something up at one of the hospitals here, that you can come in after hours and get it done, because yeah, I know, that is just like, one more thing on your plate for sure."
"100","  So does that sound like kind of reasonable next steps to kind of see if this is something that, A, you know if it's COVID that way we know, if it's something that's bacterial we can, I'll call you and we can, or prescribe some antibiotics for that.  And then otherwise if it's just kind of some sort of other viral cold, it sounds like the DayQuil and the NyQuil have been doing the good job of kind of at least keeping you going and usually these things are pretty self-limited if it's not COVID and if it's not something bacterial."
"101","  Anything else?"
"102","  Yeah, I'm going to…"
"103","  Yeah, let me touch base about what it looks like to get the COVID swab and the chest x-ray and then the blood draws and I'll give you a call back or one of the nurses at the clinic will give you a call back and we'll have everything set up to make it as easy as possible.  Let me just look into sort of the logistics if it all and then we'll go from there.  Does that sound okay?"
"104","  Okay.  All right, Tom.  Well, we'll get those and then I'll followup with you about all the results, okay? "
"105","  All right, you take care."
