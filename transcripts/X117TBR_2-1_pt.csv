"10","  Well, you see, my wife takes care of my grandkids during the day, so that you know, like my daughter and her husband go to work.  And so I get home and they are all there and I love to death, but I just don't seem to have the energy anymore."
"11","  Last six months."
"12","  I don't, this is not getting any better, you know, so…"
"13","  It's just not, so that's what I'm concerned with."
"14","  Well, it's just, it's - I'm just dog tired.  I mean, I've just like, mainly, I've got to lay down for a while. "

"20","  Well, it keeps me, but it keeps me __."
"21","  It can be anything from something serious to just, you know, just bitching and moaning, you know."
"22","  No as that I'm aware of."
"23","  She had complained too much about it, I might ___ or anything but…."
"24","  But can ask her when I see her."
"25","  I had a friend who had that."
"26","  He'd wake up just out of nowhere, just you know, because he wasn’t breathing right."
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  No."
"29","  Yeah, twice a week."

"39","  It might be more practical now that the weather is better."
"40","  It was raining ______ umbrella."

"43","  I don't get lunch hour, you know."
"44","  Yeah, that's it."
"45","  I don't know what, I'm not sure, I don't think so."
"46","  Well no, my doctor before was like get harping on me about my diet and stuff.  He made some crack about there's no fired chicken for you and I'm like, well damn, you know?  I don't know, that's none of your, I just felt like I've been talked down to."
"47","  Yeah, no, that's why I stopped seeing him, you know."
"48","  ______ else maybe."
"49","  Okay, maybe there's not much I can do about that right now, means my wife does all the cooking at home and when I go to, I grab some meat, that's kind of fast and good, you know, to kind of balance that out.  I don't have a whole lot extra time change things up too much."
"50","  Yeah, that makes sense, yeah."
"51","  Yeah, because it's real, it’s all I can do just to keep up with what I ought to do anyway, you know."

"63","  It sounds just like a, alright you got me, thought I've gotta hang around the toilet."
"64","  Okay."
"65","  Okay, that's good, you know, that's good."
"66","  Oh, okay, you can do that now?"
"67","  Oh, that's interesting."
"68","  Not yet, but I'm due, you know.  I've been snooping around a little bit, and I guess the supply is better now than it was."
"69","  Oh, okay, I'll get the Johnson & Johnson one, yeah."

"71","  Okay."
"72","  I don’t have a problem with shots.  I'm good."
