"1","  Hi there."
"2","  Yes, yes."
"3","  I am good, I am good."
"4","  Well, I felt alright. I get real tired in the afternoon."
"5","  Here it is, maybe like six months ago, I started to notice that I was just really dragging my heels in the afternoon."
"6","  No, I just noticed that, you know, after that I just was like unusually tired that way."
"7","  I sleep good, sleep good, 7-8 hours at night."
"8","  Well, I can push through it, but it is just, see my wife, she has got our grandkids taking care of them during the day.  When I get home, I want to play with them because they are just, but they just run me ragged.  You know, especially the 2-year-old.  He is just, he is in everything.  So it is but I, I really kind of miss not being able to play with them, you know?"
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Well, it is kind of it is going up I think it is kind of, I have been to the doctor, so I am just come"
"11","  I know that is too long."
"12","  Hmm."
"13","  No, no, it has been pretty steady."
"14","  Well, I get up in the morning, have a cup of coffee with cream, eggs and hash browns, a little butter."
"15","   That is breakfast. I mean, lunch is whatever I can get a hold of.  I have to leave work. I am a home care coordinator at an old folks home. "
"16","   Which is nice, but I mean, it is just like you have there is no peace, you know, if I am around, somebody is going to come to me, but their refrigerator is not working or yeah, too cold or, you know, and stuff like that, you know?  So I have to get away for a while.  So I go to McDonald's, I get like 1/4 pounder of a coke and some fries."
"17","  The dinner is whatever my wife cooks.  She does all the cooking there.  It is generally steak and potatoes and you know maybe some soda and I occasionally have a dish ice cream."
"18","  Yeah, just after that last went to the doctor, my wife and I started doing walks."
"19","  With weather permitting, you know. I like it. "
"20","  I like to get a walk around the neighborhood when you go to the local park, it is nice."
"21","  I have not noticed anything."
"22","  No, I could use a little weight loss."
"23","  I have noticed a minute."
"24","  You know I might miss dosage on every other, maybe even two weeks or something like that, but generally pretty, I am pretty right on."
"25","  I had my blood pressure checked last time and it was 130/80 which they told me it is pretty good."
"26","  They told me about my cholesterol is a little high."
"27","  Well, they mentioned it, but it never got around to actually get okay."
"28","  Yes, it looks like it is the cholesterol of my blood."
"29","  They were explaining the types to me.  One of them is good, one of them is bad."
"30","  I guess it is sort of a kind of a creature habit."
"31","  Well, my wife does all the cooking, so I do not really, you know, I do not mess with it you know."
"32","  You know, I do not want to make her unhappy about this, you know, so."
"33","  Well, I do not know, maybe get like a chicken sandwich. I guess I got that."
"34","  Yeah, I suppose so, you know, well it just seems funny because, I mean, I have been eating the same thing forever, you know, and suddenly it is kind of like bad. I do not know, it is."
"35","  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I guess it is "
"36","  Well, I think I pee a little bit more."
"37","  Yeah, okay, yeah."
"38","  Yeah, okay."
"39","  Well, I actually cannot think of it.  The thing that bothers me really is I am just worried about my energy levels, you know, I have done just some sort of downward slide from being old, you know?"
"40","  yeah, yeah, okay."
"41","  Yeah, I have had.  I keep track of my blood sugar, but it is they generally told me to have it before eating anything in the morning."
"42","  I do it like twice a week and you know, in the morning before I have breakfast."
"43","  Well, this morning it was 215."
"44","  Close to the, you now, 210, maybe it might go 216-217 sometimes but it is right around that."
"45","  Yeah."
"46","  Yeah, yeah."
"47","  Oh, it is for the cholesterol."
"48","  Yes."
"49","  Oh, good okay.  That sounds good."
"50","  Ah, no, no, no.  Yeah, I thought that it makes sense, makes sense, what about the tiredness had something to do with diabetes.  That was my first thought you know."
"51","  Yeah, we will do, we will do."
"52","  Ah, no, that is about it."
"53","  Alright, thank you."
