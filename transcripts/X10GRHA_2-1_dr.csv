"1","  Hi, Freddie."
"2","  Good. How are you doing?  Very nice to meet you."
"3","  Oh, not at all.  That happens to me and everyone else multiple times.  (Laughing) "
"4","  Technology is very wonderful and also can be very annoying sometimes."
"5","  Well, so tell me, how have you been doing in general?"
"6","  Awesome.  I am glad to hear that you are back to see us and I know diabetes can be something that is really hard to control and so I am really glad to hear that you are coming back to us.  Was there anything else that you wanted to talk about today?"
"7","  Awesome.  I am glad to hear that.  The one reason why I ask is that I noticed that you had said, written on the chart here, that you are feeling a little more fatigued recently."
"8","  And what do you attribute that to?"
"9","  Oh dear (Laughing) I am glad you brought up the fatigue then.  Do you mind if we talk a little bit about that today as well as your diabetes, because sometimes those can be related"
"10","  I would like to hear a little bit more.  How long is this fatigue been going on?"
"11","  And has that been getting worse? Better? Changed at all"
"12","  Little worse? Right.  Any issues with increased thirst at all?"
"13","  Okay.  Alright, but couple random symptoms I want to ask.  Any chest pain? Shortness of breath?"
"14","  Okay, neither of those."
"15","  Great.  Well, I agree that the fatigue could be due to the diabetes.  Sometimes that is something that can be related.  What sounds like you are not really able to do the same things that you used to with that, is that accurate?"
"16","  How? What is the longest you are able to walk these days would you say?"
"17","  Okay, 10-15 minutes two times a week, alright?  And kind of going along with the diabetes conversation, how has your diet been recently?"
"18","  That is totally understandable.  I get it.  It is hard when someone else prepares your meals for you that, especially if they are really good.   (Laughing) It can be a little hard to change."
"19","  Hahaha.  Umm, well.  I am wondering what do you think a reasonable goal for your diabetes is for you like is there some goal that you are trying to get to with your diabetes?"
"20","  I think those are really good points.  I think we could probably get your diabetes under better control from what I have seen with other patients.  I know your numbers are trending upward, which definitely can be due to aging processes, but that means that we have to go out it a little harder with either the medications or exercise or diet or one of those things in order to prevent long-term consequences of diabetes. "
"21","  So my question is, is there of the diet, the exercise and the medications?  Which of those do you think would be the easiest for you to change? Or. Sorry, I should back up.  Are you taking your medications right?"
"22","  Hahaha."
"23","  How often are you taking them?"
"24","  You are doing a great job then, because that is better than a lot of people with their meds."
"25","  So you are taking your medications, you are walking a little bit, you know, diet-wise, it sounds like you are not able to change that much.  I am wondering if you would be.  How would how would you feel about increasing the metformin?  I think it would lower your blood sugar to a better point."
"26","  Yeah.  There is a little.  I am wondering, did you have any when you started it?  First I should ask."
"27","  Great, great."
"28","  And your metformin can have a little bit, it can cause some GI upset, which in other words, in normal terms that just means it can cause some stomach upset."
"29","  And a way to get around that is to start it at a lower dose.  So instead of going, so you are taking 500 mg twice a day?"
"30","  Okay.  So we could increase that to maybe 750 mg twice a day and then increase that up to 1000 mg twice a day, umm, which would be increase up to two pills a day instead of one pill twice a day. "
"31","  So you can kind of increase it in increments rather than increasing it too fast, which can cause that kind of GI upset.  Right now, your A1c is I think the last time we checked it was 7.9 which is a little which is, you know it is not really like I have seen much worse.  You are doing pretty good but I think we want to keep it around the 7.4 range or so. "
"32","  So if we could do that that would be great.  And I think that increasing the metformin might help you a little bit."
"33","  What questions do you have about that?"
"34","  Yes."
"35","  Right.  "
"36","  I was just going to say I think that I think it is great that you are that you are coming to us and concerned about it.  So I think it is good thing that we are addressing this now and so we do not have to worry about it later. "
"37","  One other kind of thing that I am thinking that is a little bit separate from the diabetes is along with the fatigue that you had brought up, I am a little worried that it could very well be the diabetes, but I am wondering if you would be okay with us running just a couple more tests to see if anything else could be going on, such as just some basic labs one that checks your blood count to check for anemia, which is a low blood count and then your thyroid as well and then repeating that A1c. "
"38","  Would that be okay with you?"
"39","  Okay, great, hmm, if there is anything else?  Those are the main things.  One thing I wanted to just alert you about is that I noticed that your colonoscopy is you did it 10 years ago, but it will be coming up due pretty soon, hmm, which is, if you remember, they put a scope down your esophagus and take a look at your stomach and everything and make sure actually kind of go up the other way."
"40","  You know better than I do.  Hahaha."
"41","  Hahaha"
"42","  This way it feels better.  Hahaha."
"43","  Oh man, so yeah.  So that is something that I would recommend doing in the near future if that is alright with you because if you are having some symptoms of fatigue sometimes just making sure we are up to date on those normal maintenance labs and studies can give us answers to why people are feeling fatigued."
"44","  So after all of that kind of information.  How are you feeling about the diabetes?  Do you feel like we have a good plan for you?"
"45","  I hear you.  I think we can get around this without insulin right now."
"46","  It is possible that later on down the road we might need to use insulin to control your blood sugar but at this point, I think you are okay."
"47","  One thing that I would say that that some studies have shown is just another plug for getting out when you have a little extra time to get some more exercise that helps increase your body's production of insulin, exercise actually does, so one of the things to prevent you from having to use it later on is to actually get out and exercise more often."
"48","  So just another plug"
"49","  If that is something you are interested in, but I totally get it.  I am glad that you came and talked to us, but I can reassure you right now that I do not think we need to do that."
"50","  Awesome. Anything else that you would like to address today?"
"51","  Okay, awesome.  Well, wonderful.  It was very nice to meet you. Freddie."
"52","  Yes, that sounds great and we will increase, I will put the order in for increasing the dose of your metformin and then I will write the instructions so you can take a little bit easier."
"53","  Perfect. Wonderful. Very nice to meet you."
"54","  Bye, bye."
