"7","  Correct, sugars in my blood, I guess."
"8","  Well, I got this little meter and it shows me green, red and yellow and as long as I'm in the green I'm good, but I've been tethering about the yellow line which is cautionary.  I think it's probably in the 200s."
"9","  Well, I try and do it at least a couple of times a week."
"10","  Generally I'll take it in the morning and if I think about it, I might take it in the evening."

"29","  No, no."
"30","  No."
"31","  I haven’t noticed anything like that."
"32","  Yes, yes."
"33","  No, no, it doesn’t.  Just ignore that."
"34","  No."
"35","  Well, I've really been tired lately."
"36","  Well, you know, I come home from work and I want to get down and play with my grandkids, but I just, I just don't have the energy."
"37","  I do, I do and they're so active, but I just can't hang. "
"38","  Oh, I've got three, all under eight."
"39","  Oh yeah, they keep me quite busy."
"40","  No, she looks after them after school."
"41","  Yes."
"42","  Oh, that has been a while now."
"43","  Well, if I wasn’t so tired and wasn’t peeing all the time, and the sugars wasn’t so high, I guess."
"44","  I could, I could feel all right I guess."

"52","  No."
"53","  No."
"54","  Well, I think it all ___ something, yes."
"55","  Adjust my medication."
"56","  Well, you know, I've been taking this medicine for so long and well, you know, getting into a new routine takes all that extra time and thinking about it and doing things differently.  I don't know."
"57","  Oh, I like that."
"58","  Well, if this is going to let me spend more time with the kids, I'd like that."
"59","  Well, if it's going to give me more energy to play with my grandkids, I think that's okay."
"60","  Well, yes, I could do that."
"61","  Okay."
"62","  Fine."
"63","  Okay."
"64","  Yeah."
"65","  Well, when can we get started?"
"66","  I think I can make that happen.  I can fit in my schedule."
"67","  Okay."
"68","  Well, I guess you're going to give me a little bump in my meds and we're going to get started right away and you'll be getting hold of me."
"69","  Okay."
"70","  Okay."
"71","  I think that covers it.  You've got me on a plan."
