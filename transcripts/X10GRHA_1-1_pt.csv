"1","   Hi Molly."
"2","  Well, I have been better.  I will survive, I guess."
"3","  Well, basically I just got a cold, but my girlfriend thinks it is COVID, so I have to come in and/or I have to get off work and get online and do this, so here I am."
"4","  Oh last, maybe last Monday or Tuesday just the beginning of the week."
"5","  Oh, well, I got this itchy throat and my nose has stuffed up and a kind of general, kind of worn out feeling and, excuse me, I guess some kind of feverish, kind of warm feeling sometimes.  I do not know, just the cold as far as I can see."
"6","  About, about a week ago."
"7","  No, it is pretty much the same."
"8","  I just think if you got a cold and you take a bunch of medicine, it will take two weeks and if you do not take any medicine, it will take two weeks, so it is basically it is a cold, it will run this courses is what I figure."
"9","  Yeah, I guess so.  Sure."
"10","  Oh no."
"11","  Well, I would have checked it.  I had a thermometer, but I think my ex took that, so I have not seen that for years."
"12","  Well, she is just concerned about my health.  My girlfriend, Emily is ______."
"13","  She just wants to make sure that it is not COVID."
"14","  No."
"15","  Nope."
"16","  I work in construction and so I can walk all day long and that is basically what I do is move around and carry stuff and nowadays tell other people to carry stuff and send it from here to there and back again sometimes, but I am busy.  I am active and I keep fit on the job."
"17","  I work from 7"
"18","  Yeah, I guess so."
"19","  Well, just my nose is stuffed up, but that is the main thing."
"20","  No."
"21","  Well, yeah, I get diarrhea."
"22","  May be, not regularly, just maybe once a week or so."
"23","  This is the first time I have been to a doctor in what, ten years or more so, but I do not think so."
"24","  Ha."
"25","  Just I want to make sure that I do not have COVID and make my girlfriend happy.  Is there something else that we ought to look at?  Is there something else that we haven't, that we ought to see.  I mean, what?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","  So, I have COVID then, I."
"28","  I _______."
"29","  Okay.  How we do that?"
"30","  How do we do that?"
"31","  Well, that is the main thing, I guess, is to make Emily happy.  I want to get the tests or whatever, so that she knows I just have a cold."
"32","  I am not coughing a lot, so it is not like it is difficult."
"33","  No, if you could send it to me that would be good."
"34","  Okay, let me think about that one."
"35","  _______."
"36","  That is good."
"37","  Sounds like a, sounds like a plan, I guess.  So, I will get that kit in the mail and info for Emily to read about the tests and stuff."
"38","  Oh."
"39","  Okay, it sounds good.  It is hard to go out nowadays.  It is, they say it is better but I do not know."
"40","  I have to go to work."
"41","  We all wear masks or we are going to wear hard hats anyway, so."
"42","  What?"
"43","  Yeah, sometimes, it depends on the site we are on."
"44","  Well, I do not know.  I do not want to, I will have to talk to somebody at work and see."
"45","  and think about that."
"46","  Well, could we like do the test on Friday?  How long and then get the test back and then go back to work on Monday?"
"47","  Okay, I guess we will figure out something like that then."
"48","  Okay, so anything else we need to look at or?"
"49","  I guess so.  I do not really see the problem, but I guess so, whatever, I will talk to my girlfriend and see what she thinks about it."
"50","  And get back to you."
"51","  Okay."
"52","  Okay, great, thanks."
"53","  Bye."
