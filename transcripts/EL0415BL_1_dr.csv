"1","  Hello, you Tom.  Oh, you are on mute.  Oh Tom, you are still on mute.  Here we go."
"2","  Now, I can hear you.  Hi Tom, how are you?"
"3","  I am doing well.  Thank you.  How are you?"
"4","  Okay, well, thanks for coming to see us today.  I am Hadley.  I am a fourth year UDub Medical Student.  I will be helping take care of you today.  I heard that you are in here because you have a cough.  And then you wanted a, just a general checkup."
"5","  There we go, yeah."
"6","  Okay, yeah, you know, there's, there's a lot to cover in a general checkup.  So you know, we will, we will deal with the cough and then, we will see if we have time for it after that.  Well, thanks for coming to see me.  And tell me a little bit about your cough, when it started and how you've been feeling?"
"7","  Okay and I hear you say it started out with your, your nose being congested."
"8","  And a little sore throat and then you got a little bit of a cough."
"9","  Okay.  And did you have a cough at all before this?"
"10","  Right, okay, and you are coughing anything up?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  And do you feel short of breath at all?"
"13","  No, okay.  How far can you normally you know walk without stopping?"
"14","  Okay, and you do not feel like you had any more trouble doing that recently then."
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Still been going to work?"
"17","  And any other symptoms you have been feeling?"
"18","  Okay, or just it is..."
"19","  That is fine.  You can never find them when you need them."
"20","  Okay, but feeling warm, do you feel like you have been sweating, you know into your sheets or having to change your clothes more often or anything?"
"21","  Okay, just going to ask you about a few more things to make sure we do not miss anything.  Um, have you been having any headaches?"
"22","  Okay.  Any loss of, loss of sense of smell?"
"23","  Changes in your vision."
"24","  And any muscle aches or body aches?"
"25","  From working."
"26","  That is okay, but nothing worse than normal."
"27","  Okay.  Any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea?"
"28","  Okay.  The diarrhea has not changed at all since this kind of cold came on."
"29","  Okay, okay.  ________ and then have you been around anybody that had COVID?"
"30","  Yeah, I am sure, okay.  And you wear a mask when you go outside and you are trying to keep your physical distancing.  Well, that is okay."
"31","  Have you gotten any of your COVID vaccines yet?"
"32","  Okay, yeah, um, you know, what are your, what are your thoughts? What do you think would make you want to get the vaccine?"
"33","  Umm.  Is there anything that you are worried about, about the vaccine?"
"34","  Is there anything specific you are worried about? about the vaccine?"
"35","  Okay. Okay.  All right.  Let me make sure I got everything on your cough here.  Oh, have you been taking any like over-the-counter medications to help with your cough or your kind of cold?"
"36","  Okay.  Are those helping you?"
"37","  Okay, what do you feel like they help with the most?"
"38","  Okay, sounds good.  And it looked like from your, I looked at your chart, and it looked like you are very healthy.  You do not have any major medical problems that you know of?"
"39","  You do not take any medications regularly."
"40","  No, okay.  Sounds good.  And it looks like you are young age of 58.  Have you done, when was the last time you saw a doctor?"
"41","  Okay, that sounds good.  Okay, well, um, you know, I think well, I can talk to you about your cough and then just in terms of your general health, you know, there is a lot to do for just checking up on your general health we can or you said you are having some diarrhea.  Is there anything else that you feel like, not working as well as it should?  Parts feel broken?"
"42","  Do you exercise?"
"43","  Okay, that is great.  That sounds excellent.  And, you know, of course very important for your health.  And, and do you use tobacco or drink alcohol?"
"44","  I drink a little beer.  I do not use tobacco or smoke at all."
"45","  Have you ever used tobacco regularly in the past?"
"46","  Yeah, okay, that is fine.  And how many drinks of alcohol do you have in a normal day or week?"
"47","  Yeah, just answer so that I can put it down in your chart.  How many do you know, how many you know, cans of beer do you normally have with dinner?"
"48","  Any changes in that recently, increased or decreased?"
"49","  That is interesting.  Do you feel like there are any problems with that amount of drinking for you?"
"50","  Okay, okay.  All right and in terms of other, you know, general health things that we talk about in your 50s.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?"
"51","  Okay. And any major medical condition that run in your family?"
"52","  ________ for your dad?"
"53","  Okay, yeah.  And that makes it you know, all the more important, we will put in a referral for you to if you are interested to go have a colonoscopy.  That is what we do to check for colon cancer.  Is that something you are interested in?"
"54","  Yeah.  While it sounds like Emily is really trying to take good care, yeah just make sure that you are as healthy as can be, so that you are around with her.  Do you mind if I give you a little information about why we do colonoscopies?"
"55","  Do you know a little bit about what happens in that procedure?"
"56","  Yeah, well, so you would go see a gastroenterologist, which is a specialist in your kind of your stomach and your intestine system.  And it is not the most fun, like you said, but if they help you clean out your bowels, you drink something and then they put a scope into your colon and they look for things that could be colon cancer, and it is really the best test we have to make sure that we catch things that may become colon cancer early.  And because you have someone in your family that has had colon cancer, I think it is a really important test for you to have."
"57","  Yeah, yeah, that's important and well, thank you, I will put that referral in and then you know, they can also talk to you about that diarrhea you have been having, it may be related and they can help with that as well."
"58","  Kind of they are, they are specialists in that, so."
"59","  Okay.  And then, you know, given your age, I normally like to check some labs, just to keep an eye on things, look at your cholesterol and all your blood counts and things like that.  Are you okay with that?"
"60","  It is hard check done every few years, you know, we just check all the systems, make sure they are all ago."
"61","  Okay.  And then, in regards to your cough, you know, and it, if you, you already do sound like a cold, you do not have kind of the fever or chills or sweating or, you know, loss of your sense of smell and things, but since COVID is so prevalent in our community and testing is so easy, we just do a little Q-tip right in the tip of your nose and I do think that's something we should just test for.  It is very easy, the results come back in about 24-48 hours and you should stay home until those results are back.  Most of the time, they just take overnight and just to be sure, it is a very easy test and then we will know that that this is just a cold and then you can continue to just go about what you have been doing."
"62","  Do you have any questions for me?"
"63","  Um, yeah, I think that those are all of the major things.  When we get your tests back, then we can talk about the results.  If you pass with flying colors, then you do not have to come back and see me for another year."
"64","  Well, I wish I could say I like going to the doctor, but I cannot see.  Sorry."
"65","  That's okay.  I would like to tell people to have a healthy distance for us until you need us."
"66","  Okay, well, um, keep doing what you are doing for your cold.  It sounds like that is working and we will make sure it is not COVID and then if things get worse, and you know, if they get dramatically worse of course, go to the emergency department.  If you just feel like they are not getting any better and you need some more help with how to take care of your symptoms or feel better, then of course give us a call back and I am happy to see you again."
"67","  Of course, thank you. You have a good day."
"68","  Okay. Thank you. You are allowed to leave the Zoom setting now."
"69","  Perfect."
