"1","   Hi, Mr. Jones.  Can you hear me?  I think you are muted.  You see a little microphone sign next to your, at the bottom left of your screen.  Oh, there you got."
"2","  I am good, good.  How are you today?"
"3","  Yeah, good.  Well, what, what, how can I help you today?  What do you want to talk about?"
"4","  Okay."
"5","  Yeah, yeah.  Why, I, I saw that you, before a year ago you were pretty good about getting your blood checked, going to the doctor, was there anything that stopped you from seeing a doctor last couple of years?"
"6","  Just not a good fit for you."
"7","  Okay.  Well, I am glad you are here.  Is there any symptoms or things that you are feeling that made you say I want to go see someone now?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Yeah, okay.  Has that been worsening in the last couple of days or weeks or months?"
"10","  I see that you are on the metformin."
"11","  I hope you are on metformin twice."
"12","  Yeah.  Have you started taking them those?"
"13","  Yeah, yeah.  So you have, you have been taking the same medication for the last year at the same dose?"
"14","  Do you check your blood sugars at home by any chance?"
"15","  Okay, what do, what do they typically run at?"
"16","  Okay.  Was the 215 before you ate or after you eat?  Do you remember?"
"17","  Got it and then after you eat what is, do you know what they generally look like?"
"18","  Got it.  Are you having any vision changes or do you see the eye doctor regularly?"
"19","  Okay.  Any new numbness or tingling in your feet?"
"20","  Okay, okay.  Have you had any recent falls or trips, more so than usual?"
"21","  Okay, how about any weight changes, have you gained a lot of weight or lost a lot of weight recently?"
"22","  Okay.  So just kind of feeling more fatigued, maybe some, some more urination?"
"23","  How many times are you urinating a day?"
"24","  Yeah."
"25","  Yeah.  So I do not know how much you talked with your doctor or learned about diabetes.  200 fasting is generally a little bit higher than we want for bodies.  We want, we want them to be under 100.  That is kind of our goal and the way we check that is with blood sugars and with that lab test you used to get the A1c.  Have you had A1c done in the last couple of months?"
"26","  Yeah."
"27","  Okay.  Yeah, that is kind of what I see for you around 7.4 and 7.9.  Ideally, we want to keep watching that, so that is what we used to measure, you know, how, how much glucose is in your body and how much insulin is kind of coming in to counteract it?"
"28","  Based on what you are telling me, it sounds like the medication you are on is not, is not enough medication given your current symptoms like the urinating and the fatigue and the higher blood sugars.  Have you changed your diet recently?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Yeah."
"31","  Yeah.  She is a good cook?"
"32","  We cannot all be so lucky.  That is great."
"33","  I know you said you did not, you did not really mash your last _______?  Because he was asking you to change your diets since you felt like it is because your own life and you want to make your own decisions or what was it about the diet talk that you would like?"
"34","  Yeah."
"35","  Yeah, I am sorry.  It is sometimes we write, it is easy to say right? It is easy to be like eat better, but it is hard to implement, especially are you, are you working right now?"
"36","  Okay, what do you do?"
"37","  Okay, okay."
"38","  Nice.  Nice.  I think that diet is the longer conversation to have and it is hard to make those changes.  Is there anything that you like one thing that you think you could change?"
"39","  That is great.  Do you get to do those with your wife or do you like going alone?"
"40","  Okay.  Do you feel like you are do you, where do you guys take your walks?  Is it around your house or around your place?"
"41","  That is very awesome.  That is very good."
"42","  Do you feel better since doing those walks?  Do they help you at all?"
"43","  ______ I think that is, I think that is awesome.  I am really happy you are doing that.  I think that if you can maintain that and we can talk later about making diet changes like very slowly in a way that makes sense for your life.  I think that would be, that would be great.  What you are doing right now is already a step in the right direction."
"44","  Do you, I think another thing that I wanted to do is I want to see where your blood tests are at.  Are you open to getting a blood test?"
"45","  Okay, yeah, the blood tests, if they do not have to be with our clinic, they can be at any lab, I can put an order in and whatever lab is closest to you, you can just drop in.  I can just put the order in, so they know which test to get.  I would just want to get that A1c test again and they also want to check your kidneys because it sounds like you are urinating more too, which can be a cause a symptom of, you know, less controlled diabetes."
"46","  Okay and after we check those, I think I do want to mess with your medications a little bit, just so we can get the blood sugars down, so we are a little bit lower."
"47","  Do you have any symptoms with your medications?  Do you feel okay taking them?"
"48","  Okay.  And then do you ever get, when we have you taking medication, very, very dizzy or you feel like you cannot, you might fall down or anything like that?"
"49","  Okay, so why do not we do the blood test first and they will give me a better idea of where your body is, so I know I have a better idea of how to make changes for medication.  Does that sound like a different plan?"
"50","   Okay, great.  Do you have any other questions or concerns for me?"
"51","  Okay.  It was good to see you."
"52","  Thank you."
"53","  You can go ahead and log off."
