"1","  Hello."
"2","  Yes it is and you."
"3","  I am doing kind of okay."
"4","  I have a cold, so that is thing I wanted to discuss, I mean yes."
"5","  Well, the cough is, you know, rather persistent and when I, if I cough up any phlegm, it is just like a white grayish white mucus.  Hmm, that is about it."
"6","  Okay."
"7","  Oh, it started about, gosh, three or four weeks ago."
"8","  Um, no, no, I, I generally don't get sick, no, no.  And the reason again that I am here is my girlfriend has kind of been bugging me and pushing me to come into first to see if I need to be tested for Covid."
"9","  So, that is one of her main concerns."
"10","  No, I haven't."
"11","  I am not really excited about it yet.  I read, I read up on a lot of information, but I just haven't made a decision about it yet.  And, and so I am, I am kind of waiting for the results."
"12","  So that's, that's kind of where I am now, hm."
"13","  Okay, okay."
"14","  Sure, sure."
"15","  No, it is pretty much the same.  I manage it with taking DayQuil as needed."
"16","  No, no, not really, hm."
"17","  No, no, she, she has been vaccinated and I said her again, she is a teacher.  So, she is around kids, so I can see your concern.  But you know, she has not been ill for last two or three years, I think."
"18","  Um, I would say probably about the same time as the cough started, you know, you know, I am, it's just a low grade fever."
"19","  I know it's there, right, but I am, I am just kind of guessing it is about 99. But"
"20","  Just, just tired, you know, and you know, just getting me a little loss of sleep, I think, you know as a result, you know, during the course of the night and coughing, but that's other than that, I feel pretty good, hm."
"21","  No.  The only other thing that happens to be on a, I guess a regular basis is that I have like frequent diarrhea."
"22","  It occurs, you know, at least once weekly and has been going on for the past three years."
"23","  No, ha ha ha."
"24","  Exactly, exactly."
"25","  Right, yeah."
"26","  No, no."
"27","  Hm, yeah."
"28","  That is still true."
"29","  Um, no, not anything that's noticeable."
"30","  To comment on, hm."
"31","  In my current state of having this cold?"
"32","  Hm, I would say probably on a scale of maybe 4 or 5."
"33","  And you know, that is again, that is you know, it is just a good guess.  I generally don't get sick."
"34","  Yeah, I would say 5, yes."
"35","  No."
"36","  No, no."
"37","  No, like I mentioned earlier, the only thing that I take now is DayQuil and I only take it as needed.  You know, that's about it."
"38","  No."
"39","  Um, that is questionable.  I haven't been seeing anyone for the last 10 years.  So I, I would assume that I am, I am current on my shots, but I could not guarantee it now."
"40","  Okay."
"41","  Say it again?"
"42","  No."
"43","  No."
"44","  Well I, first I work in construction, and then I generally will bike ride with my girlfriend in the evening after work."
"45","  You know, we tried to do that one to two times a week.  And then take, you know, like a short two mile walk when we take a vacation.  But that is in terms of relative exercise, that is generally what I do, but like I said I work in construction moving all the time."
"46","  Oh, yes."
"47","  Well, you know, my, my grandpa, he had colon cancer and he died.  But you know, I am not sure you know, at what age or whatever because I was fairly young at that time.  And my mother, she beat breast cancer."
"48","  But she died about two years ago of natural causes and my girlfriend, you know, that is really good.  My dad is still alive, but I do not know if he has any health problems on that."
"49","  Hmm."
"50","  Um, yeah, I think that, I think that would be good.  I, again, I am more here to satisfy my girlfriend, haha."
"51","  That will, you know, yes, I would agree to that, hm."
"52","  Okay, okay."
"53","  Well unless I, I would say that, you know, from all that I have kind of read upon in terms of Covid, you know, there is some pros and cons about it and etc.  But if you feel that it is, you know, prudent or you know, appropriate to get a flu shot now, I would, I would agree to it.  Not happy but you know, if you will save a life and have made my girlfriend happy, I guess I will be happy, hm."
"54","  That makes sense, are you going to do both shots at the same time, or they are gonna be spread out over a period of time?"
"55","  Okay, okay."
"56","  All right, well, with that in mind, I work Monday through Friday, so I could you know, kind of do it on a, on a Friday __________ and Saturday, you know, to recover and maybe possibly Sunday if I have some type of"
"57","  Late reaction to it, okay."
"58","  Okay, hmm."
"59","  No, do you?  Do you feel that you know, I know, I have not been in to see a doctor in 10 years."
"60","  Is there anything else that you think I should do or be doing other than the, the flu and COVID shots?"
"61","  I haven't had one, no."
"62","  Hm hm."
"63","  Hm, okay, hm."
"64","  Yes, I am with Premier and so they do need referrals, Yes."
"65","  Okay, all right.  Well, that sounds like a plan.  So, you are giving me relatively a clean bill of health, ha ha ha."
"66","  Okay."
"67","  Okay, okay, all right, okay, that looks like a plan, okay."
"68","  No, no, I do thank you and hopefully by getting the shots, you know, the cold and whatever will go away, okay."
"69","  Okay."
"70","  Thank you, same here."
"71","  Bye, bye."
