"1","  Hello, how are you doing Mr. Johnson, is that correct?"
"2","  Yeah, good to meet you.  My name is Ben.  I'm a University of Washington medical student, here to see you today.  How are you feeling?"
"3","  Slight cold, is that what you said?"
"4","  Sure."
"5","  Sure, sure.  So tell me a little bit more about the symptoms you've been feeling?"
"6","  Okay."
"7","  Okay.  Did you take your temperature at home by chance?"
"8","  Just kind of felt hot?"
"9","  Yeah, okay.  Any chills or night sweats or anything like that?"
"10","  Okay, okay.  And any muscle aches or pains, joints bothering you that accompany these symptoms?"
"11","  Okay.  And when did these start did you say?"
"12","  Few weeks ago.  And have they been persistent since that or have they been getting worse, getting better?"
"13","  Persistent, okay.  Kind of just not going away?"
"14","  Yeah, absolutely and I think that was the right move, definitely.  And you mentioned your cough is wet, is that right?"
"15","  Yeah, what do you mean by wet, are you coughing, are you coughing some stuff up when you do?"
"16","  Yeah.  What's it look like?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Okay.  No dark green or blood or anything that you could see?"
"19","  Okay.  Anyone that you know of, I know you mentioned you had a girlfriend or anyone else that you know that has symptoms similar to yours?"
"20","  No, you are the only one?"
"21","  And I know you're worried about COVID and that's something that we can definitely check for and something that could cause symptoms like this.  Have you had COVID in the past?"
"22","  Okay, have you had symptoms like this in the past?"
"23","  No, not at all?"
"24","  And do you get colds and allergy symptoms?"
"25","  Okay."
"26","  Yeah, no, that's definitely, I mean with, in this day and age it's important to be cautious right, with COVID and everything going on."
"27","  Yeah.  And so, does this feel different than cold kind of seasonal allergy symptoms that you've gotten in the past?"
"28","  Feels pretty similar.  And do you know if you've gotten in touch or in contact with anyone who has COVID or had COVID?"
"29","  Not that you know of, okay.  Well, what do you do for, do you work Mr. Johnson?"
"30","  Okay.  And are you, do you see lots of people during the day?"
"31","  Yeah, and possibly picked it up at work maybe if you've gotten an infection."
"32","  Okay, sure, sure.  And just to think of other symptoms or systems that might be involved, have you had any headache or changes in vision or anything during these, during this."
"33","  Not really, okay.  Have you felt any real trouble breathing, shortness of breath or wheezing or anything like that?"
"34","  Okay.  Any heart symptoms at all, palpitations, chest tightness or anything like that?"
"35","  Okay.  And belly is doing okay, any pain there?"
"36","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, I think, you know, I think COVID is something that we definitely want to keep on our list, but you know, there's seasonal stuff in winter, springtime, allergens are starting to pop up that can cause symptoms like this too, but a COVID test is definitely something that we can do for you.  Have you taken anything for your symptoms at all, any over-the-counter remedies?"
"37","  DayQuil, do you get, has that helped at all?"
"38","  Okay, okay."
"39","  Yeah.  I think that's okay to continue if that's given you some relief.  Are you able to sleep through the night?"
"40","  Yeah, you don't need to do anything at night to help with cough suppressant or anything like that?"
"41","  Okay.  Yeah, I think we can continue with that and check you for COVID to make sure that you don't have that and if not, I think this sounds like just a little viral bug that you got which causes these mild coughs.  If it persists for another week or so without getting better, it might be a bacteria and we might need to do an antibiotic, but at this point I don't think we need to go down that route quite yet, just see if your body can fight it off.  But in this day and age, with COVID going around, I think it's safe to just get a test for you."
"42","  Does that sound good?"
"43","  Yeah.  And have you, are you still going to work and still doing your normal life, these symptoms haven’t been limiting you in those regards at all?"
"44","  That's excellent, that's good to hear.  Well, Mr. Johnson, is there anything else I can help you with?"
"45","  Yeah, yeah, we can do that for you, absolutely.  All righty.  Well, otherwise it was great to meet you, great to get to know you’re a little bit and hopefully we can get these results back to you soon.  All righty?  Oh looks like I lost audio for you there."
"46","  Oh, did you say it is okay?"
"47","  I think we've had a cut out there just for a brief moment.  But I was just saying it was a pleasure to meet you."
"48","  Yes, sorry really to meet under these circumstances, but we'll hopefully get these results back quick and let you know what they show, all right?"
"49","  All right.  Well you have a good rest of your day.  Okay?"
"50","  All right."
