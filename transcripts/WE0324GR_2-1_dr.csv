"1","  Hi there!  I don’t know if you can hear me but it looks like you are on mute.  I think you are on mute.  Do you see the microphone button in your left lower corner?"
"2","  There you go, I got your sound but then your video turned off."
"3","  Okay."
"4","  Here we go."
"5","  Well great.  Hi!"
"6","  Good to see you Mr. Johnson."
"7","  How are you feeling?"
"8","  Yeah, so I saw that in the notes that there is sort of two items on the agenda today where you want to talk about possible COVID and then also do a general checkup.  Can you hear me okay?"
"9","  Yeah, okay, okay is there – so just we’ll talk about those in a little bit.  Is there anything else on the agenda, anything else that you want to cover today?"
"10","  That’s it, okay."
"11","  Okay, so you mentioned that it can be difficult to do a general assessment over telehealth, virtually and I would agree with that.  Generally in my general check-ups I like to see you and be able to do a physical exam but I have an idea, I thought maybe for our visit today we could talk about your current infection, maybe COVID and then also chat a little bit enough for me to decide what labs.  I would like you go get before I checkup and then you could go get those labs and then come in for a checkup in person and then we can have those labs all set and have some stuff to talk about when we meet.  You are looking a little – tell me about what’s coming up for you right now?"
"12","  Yeah, so regarding the cold that’s sort of a separate thing from the checkup to just talk about your general wellness and do some preventative medicine.  So, would you be willing to come in separately for a visit or in person or do you want to just do what we can today virtually?"
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  Okay, well that’s a good idea, let’s start with today and just kind of see where it takes us okay?"
"15","  So, let’s start by talking about your infection, I am sorry you are feeling sick.  When did your symptoms start?"
"16","  Okay, okay and then tell me about how you are feeling, what symptoms are you having?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Sure.  Have you measured your temperature, do you have a thermometer?"
"19","  Okay.  So, you are feeling warm but you haven’t checked your temperature?  Okay."
"20","  Okay.  Are you sneezing at all or having itchy eyes, itchy or red eyes?"
"21","  Sort of itchy eyes?"
"22","  Okay, okay.  Have you taken a COVID test at home or anywhere?"
"23","  Okay.  Any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?"
"24","  Okay.  And then have you tried anything medication wise to manage this?"
"25","  Okay.  And have you been, since Tuesday have you been feeling better, worse or staying about the same?"
"26","  Okay, have you been around anyone who is sick?"
"27","  Okay, and then no wheezing or you already said no difficulty breathing, okay.  Do you have a history of any respiratory problems like asthma or COPD or emphysema? "
"28","  Have you ever used tobacco?"
"29","  Okay, okay.  Alright, well Mr. Johnson it sounds to me like you as you suspected you probably have an infection, it would be reasonable to get a COVID test and would you be – we can do that at our clinic, we have drive-through testing.  Would you be willing to get a COVID test today?"
"30","  Yeah, you can just stay in your car and we’ll come out to you and do a nasal swab."
"31","  Well, I think you might have a cold but I cannot rule out COVID and if you have COVID, we would like to know.  I am thinking it could be either a cold or a COVID.  I am not particularly worried about anything dangerous or scary given that you are having any trouble breathing and you don’t have a history of asthma or COPD.  And then given that it’s only started on Tuesday and you’re not feeling too bad, I’m not particularly worried about pneumonia at this point.  But you know COVID can feel like this and regular you know run-of-the-mill viral infection can feel like this as well, so I think it is reasonable to get tested."
"32","  Okay, in the meantime DayQuil and NyQuil is appropriate.  You can also take Tylenol up to 1000 mg per day, okay, help you manage these symptoms."
"33","  Tylenol it can help bring your fever down and it can help with the throat pain as well."
"34","  Given that I don’t know what your blood pressure is, I think you should avoid NSAIDS at this point that would be something like ibuprofen or Aleve, okay?"
"35","  Okay and then try to drink plenty of fluids okay, that will keep you feeling better and help loosen up the mucus and help you clear the mucus you’re coughing up, okay?"
"36","  Alright and then get plenty or rest.  Have you been going to work?"
"37","  While have you been feeling sick?"
"38","  Okay.  So, if you do test positive from COVID we’re going to have you stay at home from work for a little bit just to make sure that you’re keeping your coworkers safe and we’ll, but we’ll just kind of go from there okay.  If it is positive, we’ll have a separate discussion about how to manage that."
"39","  Tell me about how you’re feeling about that plan?"
"40","  Okay.  Thank you for going to do that, I know it’s not what you want to do on your day off on a Saturday here so, but it’s important, so thank you for doing that."
"41","  Alright.  So, the other think that we wanted to talk about is a general checkup and I would like to see you in person for that, but before we do so, let’s get some labs cooking, so we have some results that we can go off of, okay?"
"42","  Okay.  So, something that I want to check yearly for anyone of your age is lipid panel to look at cholesterol and I want you do a complete metabolic panel to look at your kidney function, liver function and then a hemoglobin A1c to check your blood sugar and see if you’re in the diabetic or prediabetic range okay?"
"43","  No that that you’re saying in particular."
"44","  Yeah, sorry go ahead."
"45","  So, I have kind of moved on to talking more about preventative health stuff, but doesn’t have to do with the cold today."
"46","  But maybe I should backup a little bit.  Given that you’re feeling sick do you want to just defer the discussion of the general checkup to a different time and kind of deal with one thing at a time here?"
"47","  Yeah, okay."
"48","  Okay, so how about this for a plan, I’ll put in some orders for the lab.  When you’re feeling better you go to the lab and get a blood draw okay and then we’ll schedule an appointment for six weeks from now, have it on the books and I would like to see you in person for the general checkup, but we’re going to do that later, today we’re only going to think about the cold and get you a COVID test, okay?"
"49","  Okay.  Alright so just to make sure and I explained everything correctly, can you explain back to me what the plan is that you’re going to do moving forward?"
"50","  Yeah, okay, exactly.  Few other things I want you to do today, see if your girlfriend can pick up a thermometer, I would like you to measure your temperature at home, okay?"
"51","  Do you have or does she have an O2 sat, it’s a machine that goes on your finger that monitors your oxygen level?"
"52","  Okay, that’s fine, so we’ll just stick with monitoring your temperature for now.  And some reasons why I want you to go into the ER okay, having trouble breathing."
"53","  No, no, no.  If you notice any of these symptoms, I want you to go to the ER.  I am going to list some symptoms okay."
"54","  If you are having trouble breathing, if you find yourself turning blue around the mouth or on your fingertips, okay?  If you develop a high fever of 104 or higher, or if you feel significantly worse, I want you to go to the ER, okay?"
"55","  Okay, what questions do you have for me?"
"56","  Is there anything else in particular you wanted to talk about?"
"57","  I wanted to know if there is anything in particular you wanted to talk about today?"
"58","  Alright, it sounds like she takes good care of you.  I am gland you came in today."
"59","  Yeah.  We’ll take it one step at a time okay.  Today we’re doing the COVID test, the other stuff we’ll address later and then I just let you know about reasons to go into the ER just to make sure you’re feeling safe or staying safe rather at home today but not to worry you.  If you’re feeling worse, you can go in or you can give us a call, but one thing at a time, we’re just going to start with the COVID test today okay?"
"60","  Okay, alright, I’ll go ahead and let you go Mr. Johnson and let you go to the COVID test and the results will come in to me, so if they are positive, I’ll give you a call okay?"
"61","  Okay, take care, bye-bye."
"62","  I am not sure if you stop the video or leave the meeting?"
"63","  Okay."
