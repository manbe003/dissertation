"5","  Tom, Tom works for me."
"6","  Well, it’s been about 10 years since I have had a doctor’s visit and my girlfriend is just kind of concerned, I have a cold, cold symptoms and it’s been going on for a few days and so she is a little concerned and maybe I am a little concerned that it could be COVID and so I was wondering should I be tested today."
"7","  Well, it’s been about five days now that I’ve had this cold and just a runny nose and occasionally, I will cough up some phlegm."
"8","  It’s in black and off-white color."
"9","  No."

"16","  No."
"17","  Sure, sure."
"18","  Well, I have taken or I am currently taking DayQuil."
"19","  Okay, just for my cough."

"24","  No."
"25","  No."
"26","  Well, first I just want to make sure that it’s not COVID, so it’s the main purpose and like I said my girlfriend has been pushing me and encouraging me to come in because it’s been about 10 years since I’ve been in to visit.  So, do you think there is anything else since I am here that you want to check down."
"27","  Okay, okay."
"28","  Okay, okay, alright that sounds good."
"29","  Okay, so I don’t have to wait a week for the results."
"30","  So, okay, okay, alright."
"31","  No, I think that takes care of it and again I just wanted to have this visit to first to satisfy myself and my girlfriend that I don’t have COVID.  So, it’s a great relief to know that from your analysis from what I’ve told you that that’s why I am still ______.  So, that’s a good thing."
"32","  Okay, alright. That sounds good."
"33","  Bye.  Thank you so much, okay."
"34","  Bye, bye."
