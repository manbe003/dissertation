"1","  Hi there.  My name's Allie Alderson. I am a third-year medical student.  Can you hear me?  Are you able to hear me at all?  You can hear me?  I cannot hear you.  It looks like you might be muted.  So, there is a little microphone button on your computer.  So if you move.  It should be in the bottom left.  You see that?  Cool."
"2","  All this technology, it is not easy to get used to.  I totally get it."
"3","  Hmm hmm.  Absolutely.  All right.  So are you able to hear me, introduce myself? I am Allie Alderson."
"4","  Hi, nice to meet you.  I am a third year medical student, so I am just going to ask you a few questions and try to see if I can help you out today."
"5","  Alright, so you must be Tom."
"6","  Alright.  What do you like to go by?"
"7","  Okay, sounds good.  So I was able to look at your chart a little bit and see why you are coming in, kind of sounds like you want a little bit of a general checkup and then you are worried you might have COVID, is that right?"
"8","  Okay.  Yeah, when did your symptoms start?"
"9","  Less than a week ago? Okay."
"10","  Sorry, what did you say?"
"11","  Okay and what symptoms are you having?"
"12","  Okay, have you taken your temperature?"
"13","  Okay.  So maybe feeling a little bit warm and then you have that cough?"
"14","  So with that cough, are you coughing things up?"
"15","  Okay.  What is that like?"
"16","  Okay.  Anytime like that, there is like streaks of blood in it?"
"17","  Okay.  That is good."
"18","  Alright.  So it is a little off white.  Is there a lot of it or just a little?"
"19","  Okay.  Have you ever had a cough like this before?"
"20","  Okay.  Just like with some previous colds."
"21","  Yeah.  Any other symptoms you are having?"
"22","  Okay, so like a little congested, maybe?"
"23","  Okay.  Are you having like runny nose too?"
"24","  Okay.  Right.  And that kind of started around the same time as the cough for you?"
"25","  Yeah."
"26","  Okay."
"27","  That is tough."
"28","  I am sorry you have been feeling so, so bad.  That is no fun."
"29","  Yeah.  Was anyone else at work sick?"
"30","  Okay.  So you do not know anyone else that is kind of has the same thing going around?"
"31","  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, that is nice you have those sick days."
"32","  True, true, I hear you.  Have you ever had COVID before?"
"33","  Okay.  You have never been diagnosed with it?"
"34","  Okay.  Did you get vaccines for it?"
"35","  Alright.  Okay.  And nobody at home was sick, none of your friends or anything?"
"36","  Okay.  Alrightâ€¦ I am trying to think.  Do you ever feel like you like, cannot catch your breath?  You feel like short of breath?"
"37","  Okay, so not feeling like you are having a hard time breathing.  What about taste and smell?"
"38","  Good, that is good.  I let that, you know, losing your taste would make a bad situation less enjoyable, so I am glad you are coping well."
"39","  Yeah, so like if someone brought like a cup of coffee and you think you would be able to smell that?"
"40","  Sounds good, okay.  Yeah.  So just kind of sounds like you have got a little upper respiratory virus going on; whether that is COVID or something else, kind of hard to say, but would you want to be tested for COVID?"
"41","  Okay.  So the good news about like viruses like this is that, you know, they only last a certain amount of time.  So, we would expect you to start getting better in the next couple of days."
"42","  And if you do not, if your fever gets worse or your cough gets worse and you start coughing up things that look like kind of green or like pus, we would definitely want you to come in."
"43","  Okay.  Alright, so.  I had another question and then I forgot it.  Do you have any questions for me?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, I remember what I was going to ask.  Does anything make it better or worse?  Any of your symptoms?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Okay. "
"48","  Yeah, sounds good.  So it sounds like you have been using kind of over-the-counter stuff to help you with your symptoms."
"49","  Okay.  And there is other medicines or things you can try that are also over the counter if you are interested, like have you ever used like a neti pot for your nose?"
"50","  It is like saline nasal irrigation, so you can get it in a spray or like a little bottle or like a little teapot and you rinse out your sinuses and that can help your congestion and it also can help kind of clear out the gunk in there."
"51","  Yeah.  So it is something you can just get at like the grocery store or pharmacy without a prescription if you wanted to try that."
"52","  Oh, really?"
"53","  Yeah, really?"
"54","  Yeah."
"55","  Well, I do not think it burns, the saline kind of makes it, so it is less irritating to your nose.  So kind of having that little bit of salt in there makes it less bothersome to the inside of your nose, so that is good.  It is also not the most comfortable feeling in the world, kind of having water squirting up your nose, so it just it is kind of, it is worth a shot if you want to try it."
"56","  Yeah, sounds good.  Okay.  So, I also read that you kind of wanted to do a general checkup.  Was there anything you want to check up on?"
"57","  Okay."
"58","  That was 10 years ago.  Okay.  So no, just kind of like regular checkups for the last 10 years?"
"59","  Yeah, okay.  Well, there is a couple of things that I would think about just to make sure you are, you know, doing well from our perspective, like we want to check to make sure you do not have high cholesterol or make sure your blood sugar is not too high.  That can be like a sign of diabetes.  Have you heard of those things before?"
"60","  Yeah.  Do you have any like feeling you are thirsty all the time or feeling like you pee all the time?"
"61","  Okay.  Alright."
"62","  That is good.  Yeah.  We definitely want you to keep drinking water. Sometimes if someone is like thirsty all the time and they like cannot quench their thirst, we think about diabetes a little bit.  But it does not sound like that has changed much for you.  You drink the same amount of water as usual.  No?"
"63","  Okay, sounds good.  Umm, and other things do you ever have like chest pain when you are exercising?"
"64","  Okay.  Alright.  So if it is okay with you, we will maybe just do a few of those labs and see how they look."
"65","  So you would just tell me what the closest lab to you is and you would get your blood drawn."
"66","  Okay."
"67","  Yeah.  Alright.  Well, is there like a hospital close by to you?  You _______ and stuff."
"68","  Okay.  Yeah. So, you are in Seattle?"
"69","  Beacon Hill.  Okay, sounds good.  Well, yeah, there are definitely labs nearby, and I can get you the address for one of those."
"70","  Hmm hmm."
"71","  How do you feel about that?"
"72","  Yeah, do you think you would be able to do it?"
"73","  Yeah.  That is fair.  I do not think anyone is too excited to get a needle in their arm, so I hear you."
"74","  Kind of the thing we think about with that is, the blood test is the best way to just make sure that there is nothing that we should be worried about.  And maybe think about like, you know, if you do have high cholesterol, there is ways that we can help you with that."
"75","  But the only way to know is to do that blood work."
"76","  Okay.  Sounds good."
"77","  Yeah.  That is reasonable."
"78","  And some other things we think about is like cancer screening and immunizations.  So the first thing we will talk about is kind of colon cancer screening.  So that starts at age 50.  I am sure you have heard of people doing colonoscopies before.  Is that true?"
"79","  Yeah."
"80","  Okay.  Yeah.  So that is just a screening to see if you have cancer or precancer in your colon?"
"81","  And what they do is they give you this drink and it kind of flushes out your system and then they take a little camera and look to see if there are any polyps in your colon which could be cancer or precancer."
"82","  Yes.  You are not awake for it."
"83","  We can talk about it more, too.  There is other ways to."
"84","  Yeah."
"85","  Yeah, definitely.  That is something we can keep talking about too.  There is other ones that are just kind of like stool tests.  So that is less invasive.  That is something we could do."
"86","  Okay.  It sounds good.  Yeah.  So that is something we can plan on doing.  That is called the FIT test and so they look for markers of cancer in your stool."
"87","  Would that be something you would be open to doing?"
"88","  Okay, sounds good.  So we will have that be our plan moving forward."
"89"," And then the last thing is immunization.  So you said that you work under a foreman.  What does your job kind of entail?"
"90","  Yeah, sounds good.  Do you ever feel like at work, you might like step on a nail or get scratched by metal accidentally."
"91","  That is good."
"92","  Yeah, that is good.  The thing we worry about like with every 10 years we like to give people tetanus shots just to make sure you do not get tetanus like if you did get to be like poked by a nail or something like that, get kind of a scratch that had tetanus in it, it can cause a lot of problems, and the best way to prevent it is to just get a vaccine every 10 years."
"93","  Oh."
"94","  Yeah.  Would you be open to getting a tetanus shot?"
"95","  Okay."
"96","  Umm.  Yeah, it is.  I do not know _______."
"97","  Yeah, the vaccines are pretty effective."
"98","  Yeah, so we see a lot less of tetanus nowadays which is a good thing."
"99","  Yeah for sure, definitely.  So those are the things I am thinking about just for like general health stuff.  So it sounds like we will kind of keep talking about the lab, the blood work for like cholesterol and diabetes and thinking about the stool test for the colon cancer and the tetanus shot."
"100","  So why don't you come back in a couple weeks and we can chat about that more once you are kind of feeling better from this, from this cold you have going on."
"101","  Okay.  Sounds good.  So just to kind of recap everything, so with this, you know, upper respiratory tract infection you have, the cough and the fever, things like that.  You know that you can take those over-the-counter medications and you know to come in right away or if you start to, you know, if this does not go away in a few days or start to get better, and you start having kind of coughing up stuff that looks kind of like pus, we definitely want you to give us a call right away."
"102","  Okay.  So that is for that.  And if you do not get better, let us know."
"103","  And then for the other things, we will have you come back in a couple weeks and we will talk more about that preventative stuff."
"104","  Okay."
"105","  Sounds good.  Do you have any questions for me?"
"106","  Okay, sounds good.  Well, it was great to meet you, Tom.  I am looking forward to seeing you in a couple weeks."
"107","  Okay.  Thanks."
"108","  Right."
