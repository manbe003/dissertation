"1","  Oops, hello."
"2","  I get it, yes there we go.  Oops what, hang on just a minute."
"3","  Yeah, I got it now, okay."
"4","  Oh, I feel better.  Excuse me."
"5","  I think it’s just a cold, but my girlfriend pushed me in to cabin and here I am setting up this meeting and everything to make sure it’s just a cold and not COVID.  And I think it’s a cold, but she thinks I need to get checked in on it and she wants me to have a general checkup.  I have not had a doctor's checkup in now what, 10 years or more."
"6","  Oh, you can hear my voice is all scratchy and I got a little bit of a cough and stuffed up nose and yeah, I don’t know, that is about it really.  I feel a little bit warm, you know, kind of itchy eyes and you know, it’s just a cold as far as I can see, but anyway."
"7","  I figured it’s a little bit warmer than normal about maybe a 99."
"8","  I used to have a thermometer, my ex got the thermometer, I don’t now why, but anyway, so I figure it’s about a 99.  It’s a normal kind of hot temperature."
"9","  No, I don’t think so."
"10","  Just in terms of dealing with the cough and the nose, you know."
"11","  No."
"12","  No, no."
"13","  Just my girlfriend, she is okay."
"14","  No, she is okay."
"15","  She got them some time back, yeah."
"16","  I am thinking I will just wait and see what happens.  I never needed it yet, so just trying to stay fit you know and so that’s it, as soon as I get over this cold, I think it will be okay."
"17","  No."
"18","  Oh, the DayQuil-NyQuil combination you know, it works pretty well, helps me sleep at night and I go to work in the daytime.  But other than that, just ultimately leaves me kind of dried out or I do not know, just tired."
"19","  I don’t know, not given that a lot of thought, no, I just can’t think of anything."
"20","  Yeah."
"21","  Oh yeah, I have got to go to work, that’s how the money comes in, so…"
"22","  Well, sort of, work, yeah, I work in construction, so it’s you know physical work, but I am used to it and that’s the way it is."
"23","  I don’t know, I really can’t think of any."
"24","  No."
"25","  Oh, I guess so.  So, do I go there to get it or where do I go?"
"26","  Okay, I guess."
"27","  Well, I’m just hoping everything is okay.  I mean, is there anything else that you think we ought to look at, I mean besides the cold?"
"28","  Oh, but you want me to go to the clinic to get the test, right?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  No."
"31","  Oh, great."
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Yeah."
"35","  I don’t know, I get, I mean what do you think, you are the doctor here right?  Yeah, so what do you think I got to do?"
"36","  Okay, I guess, I mean how early are you open, because I work from 7"
"37","  Until 6, oh I have got an hour and 15 minutes."
"38","  Okay, I think I will do that, I think that will work better."
"39","  Yeah, we kind of try to keep our distance from one another so that helps."
"40","  If, unless you think there is something else that we ought to look at."
"41","  Okay."
"42","  Yeah, that’s for sure."
"43","  Okie, dokie, thanks."
"44","  Oh, okay.  What do I do to this screen here?"
"45","  Let me see right now it is there, here we go.  So, I think I got it there.  If that’s the one.  Oh, there is another one."
