"1","  Mr. Johnson, hello.  I'm not able to hear you.  There's the unmute button in the bottom left corner.  Not able to hear you yet.  If you look at the bottom left corner of your Zoom screen, you'll see a microphone, there should be a red line through it and just click on that once, the bottom left of your Zoom screen.  Here, I'll type in the chat to make sure you can hear me."
"2","  Alright."
"3","  Yeah.  Do you have any listening?"
"4","  Yeah, all set.  Are you ready to start?"
"5","  Okay.  So Zoom isn’t perfect, so if we get disconnected or we freeze for a little bit, just bear with me as we get everything back under control."
"6","  So what brings you in today?"
"7","  Okay.  It's been a little while.  So let's start with the cough and then we can kind of get into the routine stuff.  Does that sound okay?"
"8","  Yeah.  So how long has this cough been going on for?"
"9","  Five days.  And do you feel like it's getting worse or staying the same?"
"10","  Okay.  Anything else with the cough, runny nose?"
"11","  Itchy eyes?"
"12","  Okay.  I think I saw a low fever and fatigue as well."
"13","  99?  You haven’t actually taken your temperature yet though, is that right?"
"14","  And did the fatigue start when the cough started?"
"15","  Yeah, more or less it did, you didn’t notice that beforehand or?"
"16","  Okay, yeah construction is a tough job, what sort of construction are you doing right now?"
"17","  Okay, does it have, come with a lot of dust and that sort of stuff?"
"18","  Yeah, what is your role in the construction process?"
"19","  Okay.  Have you noticed that anyone either at work or at home has been sick?"
"20","  No?  Any known COVID contacts that you know of?"
"21","  Well, that's good.  I think I saw on your chart, you're having a little trouble with breathing, but no loss of taste or smell, is that right?"
"22","  Okay.  Is your -- some more random questions about colds and fevers.  Have you had a sore throat at all?"
"23","  Scratchy.  Any lightheadedness? "
"24","  No.  Itchy, vision changes? "
"25","  Yeah.  And how about chest pain?"
"26","  Shortness of breath?"
"27","  Yeah.  Feeling like you are, you've had any night sweats?"
"28","  Okay.  We're just going through a big gold list right now.  Any abdominal pain?"
"29","  Okay.  Any changes to urination or bowel movements?"
"30","  Has your urinary habits changed in the last five days whether that means pain or more frequent or less frequent?"
"31","  Any diarrhea or constipation?"
"32","  Yeah, is that normal for you though?"
"33","  Okay.  And how about rashes, any new rashes?"
"34","  And swelling of the legs?"
"35","  Okay.  A couple more questions for you.  Have you been producing any phlegm or mucus when you cough?"
"36","  What's that look like?"
"37","  Okay, yeah.  That all sounds good.  Thanks for going through that with me.  And you said that your cough has been pretty much the same the whole time right?"
"38","  Yeah, okay.  Just going over a couple more things.  It looks like, I don't see any history of smoking, is that right?"
"39","  You have a couple of drinks a day, a couple of beers?"
"40","  Have you been taking anything to help with the cough?"
"41","  They work alright?"
"42","  Yeah.  Do you take any other medications at all?"
"43","  No.  No over-the-counters?"
"44","  Okay, that's it.  And then I don't see any allergies listed here for you, is that right?"
"45","  Okay.  Have you been vaccinated for COVID?"
"46","  Okay.  What sort of things are you waiting for?"
"47","  Yeah.  That sounds good.  Do you know anyone that's gotten COVID?"
"48","  Okay.  Would you, are you interested in getting vaccine today or would you like any more information?"
"49","  Yeah."
"50","  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so I think it would be beneficial for you to get a vaccine.  It sounds like you are kind of on the line of getting one.  Do you work five days a week, seven days a week, what's that like?"
"51","  Okay.  Well let's plan here and I can put in a referral for or you could go in by yourself and in a couple of weeks, there are some walk-in clinics and you could get a vaccine then after you are kind of over this thing.  Does that sound okay?"
"52","  Yeah, we’re going to, we're going to check that first, so kind of taking a step back, things we can do for your cough right now is, we need to, we'll do a rapid COVID test and then we'll also do a swab for the flu.  Does that sound okay?"
"53","  And so you'll -- we'd like you to go through a drive-through for that and you can get both at the same time, just make sure to wear a mask as you're driving through or have someone drive you through if you're feeling pretty tired."
"54","  Yeah.  Yeah, you can go drive-through somewhere and get tested for that right away.  I think it's a good sign that you're not getting progressively worse over five days, although I think it would be good to keep a close eye on you, so let's see, if they're able to send us the results we'll let you know what the results are, otherwise if they send you the results, give us a call and let us know whether you are positive or negative."
"55","  Yeah, so we want to keep an eye on whether you're positive or negative.  If it comes back negative and nothing changes here in the next day or two, it's probably just a routine seasonal virus that is about going on."
"56","  Which, that can just be managed with supportive treatment just like improving your breathing and making sure you're getting fluids and you're getting rest when you need it."
"57","  Okay.  So first things first, after this visit you can go drive-through a clinic and get tested for COVID-19 as well as influenza."
"58","  Yeah, I'll send you an address over chat."
"59","  And then you can, do you know now how to put that in your phone or maybe you're familiar with the area to get there."
"60","  Yeah, we'll check.  And let's see here, so that's kind of the cough, does that sound good with you for the cough?"
"61","  Yeah.  A couple of things to watch out for, if you're symptoms start to resolve, if you're feeling better and then the next day you start to get a lot worse, schedule another visit with us or go into a clinic to get checked out again.  That could be a sign that while your viral infection is improving, you could be getting a bacterial infection which would need to be treated with antibiotics."
"62","  Just keep a look out for that, if it gets better and then gets worse, then call in for another visit.  We'll try to get you in."
"63","  Alright.  And then as far as the general checkup goes, there's any, anything else that you wanted to chat about specifically?"
"64","  Yeah, there's lots of just routine maintenance, routine maintenance that we can do.  So in addition, we don't have to do this now since you're sick, but it would be good to get the COVID vaccine later.  It will be good to get the yearly influenza vaccine once you're feeling better, those would be a couple of things."
"65","  And since you haven’t been in to see the doctor in a while, there's a few other things we'd like to do, one of those being labs.  We'd like you to, once you're feeling better I'll put in a referral and you could come into the clinic, get your blood drawn, so we can take a look at your blood cells, your cholesterol, and then your electrolytes as well as a couple of others."
"66","  Does that sound doable?"
"67","  Yeah.  Our clinic is open early in the morning and."
"68","  Looks like a pretty bothersome cough."
"69","  Yeah.  Our clinical hours are extended before and after most workdays, so you are free to come in either before you got to work or afterwards for those blood draws."
"70","  I think we have some Saturday afternoon clinic times that you could also, you could also go to."
"71","  Yeah.  Those will be available.  Let's see, a couple of other things.  You said you haven’t been to a provider in well over 10 years?"
"72","  Okay, so it's time for a colonoscopy screening.  Have you had one of those?"
"73","  Yeah, is that something you are interested in?"
"74","  Yeah.  Most people aren’t interested in it, but it is the best test we have for detecting colon cancer.  Is it okay if I put in a referral for that for you?"
"75","  Yeah.  That would be the best thing and then you wouldn’t if all comes back normal you wouldn’t, the next screening would not be for another 10 years."
"76","  Okay.  So we have our vaccines, we have our labs, that's going to include a check of your thyroid and a check of your prostate as well and then we're also going to get that colonoscopy screening."
"77","  Yeah.  A couple of other things that's always good to check.  Since you are a construction worker, I imagine you spend a lot of time outdoors or in the sun? "
"78","  Have you or your partner noticed any abnormal skin bumps like moles that are new rather than things you've always had?"
"79","  Okay.  I recommend you either use a mirror or you have your partner help you by just doing a full skin check to make sure that there's no new mole looking things on your skin or anything else that you have a question about."
"80","  And then in addition to that, if you're doing a project and you know that it's going to be very sunny out, I recommend applying a sunscreen daily, every two hours if it is very sunny while you work."
"81","  Okay.  Do you have any questions for me?"
"82","  Well, a couple of other things, just maintenance things, when is the last time you're at an eye doctor?"
"83","  Okay, okay.  I recommend getting into an eye doctor sometime here within the next year, doesn’t need to be right away."
"84","  Just to keep that on your radar.  I'll put it in your notes.  And then what's your dental care been like?"
"85","  Okay.  Do you have insurance for that?"
"86","  Okay.  I'll also put that in your notes from today's visit, I recommend getting into a dentist in the next year.  Although we might feel that our teeth are doing well, it's really easy for us to get a cavity that can then spread places, so it's always good to just get a checkup here and there."
"87","  I'll put that in your notes."
"88","  How do you feel your hearing is doing?"
"89","  How do you feel…?"
"90","  Okay, good, good.  So what's your understanding of the next steps from today's visit?"
"91","  Yeah, you'll go to either a clinic, walk-in clinic or a drive-through to get that COVID and influenza test."
"92","  Yeah.  And then…"
"93","  After you are feeling better, but we'll just wait to see what those results say first."
"94","  Okay, and then we talked about a couple of the maintenance things for you to do.  One of those would be getting your colonoscopy, so I'll send in a referral for that.  The next one would be getting your labs, so you can come into the clinic on Saturday afternoon and get that done at your convenience, and then the vaccines, you can come into the clinic or go to your local pharmacy and get some vaccinations when it works out for you."
"95","  The last couple of things, just getting into a dentist and an eye doctor within the next year, and I'll put all of this in your visit notes, so you can look at it."
"96","  Alright.  Well, if you don't have any other questions, I think that's all for today."
"97","  Yeah, we'll see you.  Bye."
"98","  Bye."
