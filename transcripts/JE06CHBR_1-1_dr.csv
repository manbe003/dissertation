"1","  Hello?  I think your computer may be on mute there.  Okay, I know it’s Freddie.  Let us see if we can walk you through this.  Can you see in the bottom of your screen there is a little microphone button?"
"2","  Oh perfect, good."
"3","  Yeah.  Glad you got it working now."
"4","  Yeah.  How are you feeling?"
"5","  Okay.  Yeah, my name is Isaac.  I am a medical student with the University of Washington.  I am talking with you today.  I have a piece of paper and a pen, so if you see me looking down, I will just be taking some notes, if that’s okay with you."
"6","  Yeah, well, tell me what you are visiting for?"
"7","  Okay, sure what else is on your mind?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay.  So, we will touch on diabetes and some tiredness, anything else?"
"10","  Okay, well if something comes up, we can surely touch on that as well."
"11","  Okay.  Well, yeah, I guess, tell me about with your diabetes has anything changed in the past year since you have been in?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Oh sure."
"14","  Well, maybe, tell me about this fatigue."
"15","  Yeah."
"16","  Okay, yeah.  So been, been feeling pretty tired at the end of the day, not quite as energetic for the grandkids as you would hope."
"17","  Yes.  So how has your sleeping been?"
"18","  Okay.  Waking up at night at all?"
"19","  Sure."
"20","  Okay.  How often do you usually get up in the night?"
"21","  Okay, gotcha.  How do you feel when you get up in the morning?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Sure, you feel refreshed ready to start the day?"
"24","  Yeah.  Okay.  You feel sleepy throughout the day or?"
"25","  Okay, gotcha.  And over the past, you know, half a year that you have been noticing this, has it been changing at all?  Feel like it’s getting worse, getting better?"
"26","  Okay, gotcha.  Alright, any changes in your appetite?"
"27","  Okay.  How about your weight?"
"28","  Okay, gotcha.  Do you notice you do feel like weaker, you feel like you get you know out of breath when you are walking or?"
"29","  Okay, gotcha.  Okay, well what have you tried to help with this?"
"30","  Okay."
"31","  Okay, yeah.  Any changes in your vision?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, what are you on, what do you worry could be going on?"
"33","  Sure."
"34","  Okay, I am glad you are here.  So, I will see what we can do for you."
"35","  Okay.  If you had any cough?"
"36","  Okay.  How about any pain in your belly?"
"37","  Okay.  Blood in your stools?"
"38","  Okay.  Change in you know how often you haven’t had a bowel movement."
"39","  What they look like?"
"40","  Okay, gotcha.  I had a you know had a quick glance at your chart before we came in here and it looked like your last colonoscopy was about 10-11 years ago, is that correct?"
"41","  Okay."
"42","  Okay."
"43","  Yeah, that's I hear that can be a bear sometimes."
"44","  Okay, gotcha.  Do you have any numbness, tingling in your hands or feet?"
"45","  Okay, gotcha.  Well, I think you know from what you are telling me so to sum up sort of what you are saying and correct me if I am wrong here, so over the past five or six months, you have been noticing especially in the evenings you are feeling pretty tired, lower energy, have not really been you know ill in that time, noticed any changes in your stools.  No real, real changes in your lifestyle and your sleep or diet in that time, just kind of gradual in there."
"46","  Yeah, okay.  Anything you would like to add to that?"
"47","  Okay, gotcha.  And then you are wondering if maybe this could be related to your diabetes?"
"48","  Okay.  You know my first thought just thinking out loud here, don’t think this would necessarily be related to your diabetes.  I would kind of like to start by checking some bloodwork on you, would that be okay?"
"49","  And while we are at it, then we can check some of your labs to look at how your diabetes is doing, to how your blood sugar control is."
"50","  I think that would be a pretty reasonable place to start."
"51","  Okay.  Well, if that sounds good to you, you know I would like to place those in, so you can come and get that drawn and then we will -- I will call you with the results and I will be in touch from there."
"52","  Oh, okay."
"53","  Okay."
"54","  Yeah…"
"55","  Okay, yeah.  Pretty stressful job it sounds like."
"56","  Okay.  How is your mood then?  You have been feeling down or worrying?"
"57","  Okay.  Yeah, do you think you know one of these mornings you would be able to come by just to get that lab drawn?  You know it could be really be any morning when or any time."
"58","  Okay.  Well, you know I know we have thrown a lot at you, but could you just tell me what you know what our plan is from here and we will double check to make sure we are on the same page?"
"59","  Yeah, I think that would be a good place to start.  That will help us narrow things down a bit and yeah see what we can do for you."
"60","  Alright.  Well, thanks Freddie.  I think that’s all we have got for you."
"61","  Alright, we will be in touch."
"62","  Bye."
