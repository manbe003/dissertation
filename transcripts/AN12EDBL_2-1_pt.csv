"1","  How is that, can you hear me now?"
"2","  Here we go.  Sorry about the mute and unmute type situation here, hello."
"3","  Well, my girlfriend has been, you know pushing me to come in and get checked for COVID.  I have a cough, lower cold, I don’t think it’s anything serious, but I would like to know if I can get tested for COVID today."
"4","  Okay."
"5","  No, not really, I am just …tired, I just I am sleeping a little more than normal, than usual, so that could be the side effects of the cold as well."
"6","  This has been going on for about a week."
"7","  No, I’ve got colds before and it seems like it’s regular type of cold."
"8","  No, no."
"9","  Yes, uhhh."
"10","  Just my girlfriend and she is a teacher and so you could understand her concern, uhhh."
"11","  Exactly, exactly."
"12","  Well, I am a construction worker, I am a laborer for a construction company here in Seattle and so I am outside mingling with people you know all the time, but I generally wear my mask when I am around people….uhhh."
"13","  Yes."
"14","  Oh, yes."
"15","  Well, I would, but since we, you know, are doing this virtual, I just wanted to probably arrange with you an appointment in the future just for general checkup, I haven’t been in, in about 10 years and so I am a little overdue.  So, that’s really the other concern that I have had is that I haven’t had a checkup in a few years."
"16","  No, not really.  Like I said I’ve had colds before and this just seems to be a general cold, but again COVID is floating in the air.  So, I would think that probably a full checkup would probably ease my girlfriend’s mind more so than mine…uhhh."
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yes, yes, this would work for me, but you asked me about with this cold, I don’t know if you plan to ask me this or not, but I have a little cough."
"19","  Uhhh."
"20","  Right, yeah.  I would say that no difficulty in breathing and I like I said I’m a little tired, but it seems like I just you know seemed to be more tired than usual, but no loss of smell or taste or anything like that, so, but and I would say that my cough it’s a little phlegm and it’s you know had an off-white color which is I would assume is normal for cold…uhhh."
"21","  No, no, none."
"22","  Well, sometimes just a little fever, I would say probably 99, but that’s about it, okay…uhhh."
"23","  Yes, I have had you know diarrhea that I have encountered you know at least once a week and it’s been going on for about three years and so it’s just I am assume that’s what my body is doing…uhhh."
"24","  I could research it, like I said I’ve heard and read so much about COVID, I don’t know what to believe and not to believe and there are some in my location that I could probably visit that’s maybe probably 15-20 minutes away."
"25","  Okay, okay."
"26","  Exactly."
"27","  Well, the only concern is that in some of the news reports or other reports that come out about COVID, the severity of it for you know certain people or you know experiencing more complications than other and along with that is that the vaccines are their degree of efficacy on it varies, just depends on you know which, who the manufacturer is and so just a lot of things that just kind of floating out there and so I haven’t actually bought into the program yet, I am just hoping I don’t get COVID."
"28","  Can I share any information on that."
"29","  Uhhh…uhhh…uhhh."
"30","  Right, no problem."
"31","  Okay, alright, that sounds like a plan and I am quite sure that my girlfriend would be pleased that I have her somewhere clinic ___ right now."
"32","  No, David, thanks and I feel that you’ve answered my questions and for to kind of take some of the concern of in terms of whether or not the cold is the virus or not and thus far yeah, I will set an appointment and then have them send the results to you, then we can take it from there."
"33","  Okay, sounds like a winner, David."
"34","  Fine.  Thanks you so much and same here, okay."
"35","  Ohhh…okay."
"36","  Okay, thank you David for taking the time, okay, alright.  Good bye."
"37","  Okay, alright."
