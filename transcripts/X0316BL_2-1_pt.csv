"1","  Is that good?"
"2","  Oh okay, okay, good.  It wasn’t on there, because I just, I had to, I had to move my mouse a little bit and it appeared."
"3","  Yeah, actually I'm just new at it.  I don't know, I just don't know anything about it.  I've just been kind of looking it at.  I'm sorry, I will do it."
"4","  Yeah, that's great, that's great."
"5","  Yeah, yeah, it's been, it's been about a year since I've been to a doctor and I you know, I just thought it's time to check up my diabetes."
"6","  Well, the biggest problem I'm having is, I'm just so damn tired."
"7","  It's, but I have to you know I'm working at a retirement home.  There is something going on all the time, so I got to be on my toes, but when I get home, I'm tired.  I mean my wife takes care of my grandchildren during the day for my kids and they are just cute you know, they are about three of them, you know.  I love playing with them, but when I get home, I'm just so tired anymore.  I mean, I just feel like I'm kind of faking on them, you know.  I don't want to, you know, I want to be with them for, you know, the times I get to see them."
"8","  That's exactly it, yeah."
"9","  About six months."
"10","  It was sort of gradual then I just kind of like, because I just kind of passed it off as just well, I'm just, had a hard day or whatever, and it kept going, it kept happening.  I just wanted to like take a nap when I got home."
"11","  It's just a fatigue.  I haven’t had any chest pains or anything."
"12","  No."
"13","  No, my diet is pretty steady."
"14","  I think it's been going up a little bit.  I've had some recently, but it's been climbing into the yellow."
"15","  Yeah."
"16","  Yeah, this morning I had, I took it was 250."
"17","  Sort of like 130 to 200 area."
"18","  Yup."
"19","  Yes."
"20","  No."
"21","  Yeah, yeah, and I was wondering whether that's why I feel so tired all the time."
"22","  Actually, I don't know, because I started, you just started doing day walks you know like twice a week with my wife."
"23","  I've been kind of trying to up my activity level."
"24","  Yeah."
"25","  I don't know.  Really, I can't, pretty much on a schedule.  You know, I take my medication and I mean, I may miss like a pill or something every two weeks or something like that."
"26","  Actually I'm pretty good about the medication."
"27","  No, I've got, it's covered, I've got medical insurance and it's covered all that."
"28","  Yes.  In the morning I got coffee, some eggs, hash browns, a little bit of butter."
"29","  Lunch I have to go, I have to get out of, I've got to get out of the, I've got to go somewhere and I don't have a whole lot of time, so I just, I just go to the drive-through at McDonald's, I get like a Big Mac, some fries, and a bottle of coke."
"30","  Yeah, dinner, my wife makes dinner.  She is a real fine cook.  So it's generally meat and potatoes, maybe a soda and some, maybe a little bit of ice cream."
"31","  And fried chicken on the weekends."
"32","  Almost always, because I've just got to get out of there, you know, because it's one of those things, if I don't get away there is always somebody in my office."
"33","  I get a little -- I need a little time to myself."
"34","  Yeah, a little bit cholesterol I think."
"35","  Yeah, I have a cuff, you can put it on wrist stuff."
"36","  Oh, it's just generally about 130s or like the 80s something."
"37","  Well, that’s right now, that's pretty much what I do."
"38","  Well, I feel pretty good, feel pretty good."
"39","  No, no, no, I'm just thinking it's something we've been doing sometimes in the rain which I'm not having real fun, but you know, I do it, if I take an umbrella, I'm okay."
"40","  I don’t know, I haven’t noticed that."
"41","  No, it's, you know, no I haven’t noticed that.  It seems to me like during the day just sort of like catches up to me.  It seems more related to time than you know what I am doing, because I do a lot of walking.  Well, you know, I do some walking when I'm at work, so I have to kind of go check in on people."
"42","  Okay, okay."
"43","  No, not really I can think of."
"44","  Not, a long time ago I had my tonsils out."
"45","  Oh, long time ago, I might have had something.  I remember going to the hospital or something when I was a kid, but I didn’t think much of it."
"46","  Oh my mom had diabetes."
"47","  Yeah, yeah."
"48","  Not as I know of.  My dad passed away a couple of years back, but I'm not sure what he died of."
"49","  He was pushing 90 years out."
"50","  stiff wind, I don’t know."
"51","  None that I know of, nobody complained about that."
"52","  About 10 years."
"53","  Yeah, well it’s the problem that I can't fix, I've got to know who to call."
"54","  Because I'm the last, I am the one they go to with their problems."
"55","  No."
"56","  Rarely.  It would have to be like on a special occasion."
"57","  No, no."
"58","  Okay."
"59","  No."
"60","  No."
"61","  No."
"62","  No."
"63","  I do, I do, I do pee a lot, but there's no blood in it."
"64","  Years, I got diagnosed with diabetes eight years ago, so that’s been at least that long."
"65","  No."
"66","  No."
"67","  Oh…"
"68","  No, no."
"69","  Oh, oh, what is the side effects with that drug?"
"70","  Oh, that’s the worst."
"71","  Aha."
"72","  Oh, yeah, that's the really, yeah, that's the point, yeah.  Good."
"73","  Okay, just a little bit?"
"74","  Yeah, I'm willing to try that, yeah."
"75","  Well, I've been eating the same stuff for eight years.  I don't know why it would suddenly this be a problem now."
"76","  Oh, yeah.  But I do like my Big Mac."
"77","  So that's, that's a little hard.  I don’t know."
"78","  Yeah."
"79","  I can't, I'm trying to think of what's nearby there."
"80","  Because I can't be gone real long."
"81","  Or I don't know, I'll look around."
"82","  To see what's, you know, what's available, you know."
"83","  I never thought about that."
"84","  I don't know.  Yeah, well, you know, so I have to kind of up to my wife, you know, she does all the cooking stuff, so I'll have to take it up with her, you know."
"85","  So I would. "
"86","  Oh wow.  Yeah well, and that blood level, I'll talk it over with my wife."
"87","  That will be about it, I think and that will be, that might help my energy level?"
"88","  Okay."
"89","  Yeah, yeah, okay."
"90","  Well ______ that over."
"91","  Yeah, okay."
"92","  That pretty much covers it."
"93","  Oh, I have a little kit that I have with myself, do like twice a week."
"94","  I check the blood about twice a week in the mornings."
"95","  I'm not like, you know, I'm not a stuff."
"96","  I guess, yeah.  I don't like the blood draw fingertip thing."
"97","  Oh, okay."
"98","  Okay, okay."
"99","  Thank you, thank you very much."
