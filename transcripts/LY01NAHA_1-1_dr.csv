"12","  Hmm hmm.  Anything else that you have noticed?"
"13","  Hmm hmm.  What kind of usual stuff have you noticed?"
"14","  Hmm, hmm"
"15","  It is not more than usual?"
"16","  Very fair.  It sounds like it has not been kind of associated with this cough, though.  Is that right?"
"17","  Okay. You said this cough is wet; are you coughing anything up?"
"18","  Hmm hmm"
"19","  Yeah. White stuff, yellow stuff, green stuff."
"20","  Gotcha, thank you.  And it is not something that happens to you fairly frequent? Do you get coughs a lot?"
"21","  Hmm, hmm."
"22","  Yeah.  Has that been going on for about that same week?"
"23","  Hmm hmm.  Any fevers? "

"25","  Okay.  What about stuffy nose?"
"26","  Yeah.  What do you do for work?"
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Busy, busy."
"29","  (Laughs)."
"30","  Yeah."
"31","  Yeah.  Multitasking.  Gotta get things done.  I appreciate it.  Nothing wrong with that. Okay.  Anybody at work or anybody else you have been around been sick lately?"
"32","  Hmm hmm.  What about masks when you are inside with other people?"
"33","  Great."
"34","  Hmm, yeah, but that was quite difficult to get those masks for a while."
"35","  (Laughs).  Yeah.  What about folks at home, anybody sick at home?"
"36","  Yeah and you said she is vaccinated.  Are you vaccinated?"
"37","  Hmm hmm"
"38","  Yeah."
"39","  Um.  Yeah.  Well, if you have any questions about vaccination, I'm always happy to talk about it.  It is, you know, it has been a really big change that everyone has been going through and there is a lot of information, but then there is a lot of misinformation out there too.  So if you have any questions, let us ……"
"40","  So, is she teaching in person right now?"
"41","  And what age kiddos is she teaching?"
"42","  Oh, yeah."
"43","  Like ? Middle, junior high kind of age group."
"44","  Gotcha.  Lots of feelings is at that age and no idea what…."
"45","  Yeah.  Sounds about right.  Okay.  So she is feeling okay."
"46","  She is vaccinated.  She goes and teaches in person _______, anybody else at home with you?"
"47","  Let me ask you some other questions about things that you might have been experiencing to make sure I can have a full picture here.  So you said no runny nose, anything going down the back of your throat?"
"48","  Yeah sometimes, especially this time of year, some folks get a lot of postnasal drip kind of dripping."
"49","  Do you ever get allergies?"
"50","  Yeah.  And do you get a flu vaccine?"
"51","  _______ you know, we do recommend…"
"52","  No, me neither.  That is why I …."
"53","  Decided to be a doctor, so I needn't have to get poked.  (Laughs)."
"54","  (Laughs).  Flu vaccine I will make an exception for, that is a pretty _______."
"55","  Okay, we should keep working on that one, that would be nice, would not it?"
"56","  (Laughs).  Okay.  So you get a maybe a flu every year, but otherwise, it sounds like you have been a pretty healthy person.  Any shortness of breath?"
"57","  Yeah.  Do you ever get any shortness of breath?"
"58","  Hmm hmm."
"59","  Good.  Good.  Ever any pain in your chest?"
"60","  What's the scoop with your uncle?"
"61","  Umm."
"62","  Yeah."
"63","  Anybody else in your family that's had health problems?"
"64","  Hmm hmm, yeah, sorry to hear that."
"65","  Yeah, well you know, we all have to go eventually, but still hard."
"66","  Do you know what kind of cancer that was?"
"67","  Gotcha, gotcha, okay.  Any health problems on your dad's side of the family?"
"68","  Ah."
"69","  Oh yeah."
"70","  Yeah.  And do you have any siblings or kiddos or anything like that?"
"71","  Just you."
"72","  Independent, just you and your girlfriend."
"73","  Fine"
"74","  Yeah.  Chosen family is important and it sounds like she is got your best interests in.."
"75","  Hmm hmm."
"76","  Yeah."
"77","  You are gonna have to give her a thank you from me for being a great influence."
"78","  (Laughs)."
"79","  Ah, ah."
"80","  Absolutely.  Okay, a couple of more questions for you just about things that might have been going on lately, so no chest pain for you?  Do you ever feel like your heart is racing?"
"81","  Yeah."
"82","  Yeah, I got you."
"83","  How about eating and drinking?  Do you eat and drink okay?  Ever any nausea or anything like that?"
"84","  Uh, Tom, you are making me hungry."
"85","  How about belly pain?"
"86","  Do you ever have any pain in your belly?"
"87","  Okay, well, that is a good kind."
"88","  Any heartburn?"
"89","  Good.  And you mentioned diarrhea, maybe once a week."
"90","  Hmm hmm."
"91","  Fair.  Ever any blood or black stool?"
"92","  (Laughs)."
"93","  Well, if you see it…"
"94","  Alright, well, if you notice, you let us know."
"95","  Okay.  And how about headaches?"
"96","  Okay."
"97","  Good, very good.  That is excellent.  Numbness, tingling, anything like that?"
"98","  Good.  Feeling like you might pass out?"
"99","  You are doing great.  This is a pleasure.  So don't you worry about me."
"100","  I will talk to you any time, Tom."
"101","  Anything else that has been going on that I have not already asked you about?"
"102","  I am, yes."
"103","  That is why we go into medicine because we are just nosy people who like to talk to people all day long."
"104","  Okay.  Well, not to worry.  It's pretty, pretty reliably in the same spot.  So."
"105","  All right.  Okay.  A couple more questions for you.  I saw that you gave us some of the intake information.  So thank you for doing that.  I saw you have just been taking DayQuil.  Is there any other kind of medication that you take?"
"106","  Yeah.  Anything over the counter, like Tylenol.. "
"107","  Yeah.  (Laughs).  How often do you take the DayQuil or NyQuil?"
"108","  Wise choice, yeah."
"109","  Okay."
"110","  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not …."
"111","  Hmm, absolutely."
"112","  Wise choice and.."
"113","  Good.  Do you smoke?"
"114","  Did you smoke before?"
"115","  Hmm, hmm."
"116","  Yeah."
"117","  How long? Yeah."
"118","  Good.  It can be hard to quit, so, I mean."
"119","  Yeah."
"120","  Absolutely."
"121","  Hmm, absolutely.  You have other things to worry about."
"122","  I think you are getting mature."
"123","  That is right, just sophisticated."
"124","  Hmm hmm, and what about alcohol?  You mentioned some brandy.  Has that been helping you with this?"
"125","  Hmm hmm, gotcha.  Alright.  And has that been about the same?"
"126","  Recently."
"127","  Yeah."
"128","  Okay."
"129","  Always something, always something, okay.  Any other kind of recreational stuff? Marijuana, anything else?"
"130","  Yes."
"131","  Wise choice, but."
"132","  Oh yes.  Yes, absolutely protect your toes."
"133","  Okay.  So it sounds to me, with this kind of coughing that you have been having, you know, a little bit of fever, feeling really tired, you are not having a lot of shortness of breath.  I didn't ask you, but it looks like you told our nurse that you weren't having any change in your taste or your smell, is that right?"
"134","  Okay.  That loss of taste and smell is definitely the first thing we think of when we think about COVID."
"135","  Yeah, but you can have COVID without that at all.  And actually, a lot of people when they get it do not have any kind of symptoms."
"136","  So, do you think it is worth getting tested?  Just because you know, being around other people, passing it on.."
"137","  Yeah.  I think that would be you know, because you wear masks at work, which is awesome but you know, your girlfriend's around kids, kids especially oftentimes, when they get it, they don't have any symptoms.  So you know, it can be passed along and she might not get it or might not have any symptoms, especially if she's had the vaccine.  So it makes it more mild, even if you do have it.  But for you, you might have just a little bit of symptoms.  It can be pretty mild.  So I think it's worth checking if you have a home test."
"138","  Yeah."
"139","  Yeah, I think that would be a really good idea for you.  It doesn't sound like you have like a sinus infection or something that involves a bacteria.  You're not telling me you have a lot of chest pain, you're not coughing up like yellow gunk, that's all stuff that would make me think there might be a bacteria involved, when it's more just like that fever."
"140","  Yeah.  Exactly.  But if you're having like fevers, feeling exhausted kind of cough, a lot of times that can be from a viral illness, which COVID is one of them, but there's lots of them. You know, the common cold is a virus, right?  There's lots of little viruses that go around.  You don't need antibiotics for those which is great.  Mostly, it's just taking good care of yourself and not working too hard, which I am sure you don't know anything about that."
"141","  Ah ah, yeah, hmm, if I asked your girlfriend, what would she say though."
"142","  Yeah, take the day off, because you know, if you, if you take good care of it, and it sounds like you're doing a lot of the things you need to do, taking the DayQuil if that helps, or NyQuil, chicken soup, absolutely, but resting is going to be a big part of it, too.  Hmm, hmm, yeah, oh oh."
"143","  Ah ah yeah, I see you Tom, I know.  You were just working hard any, weren't you."
"144","  Yeah, the more that you give your immune system a chance to actually do it's job, which you know it is working hard, the more you give it a chance to do it's job, the faster you will get better, so let us say."
"145","  All the tests, take the day off, I know you work hard, but I think that will be okay for a day or two."
"146","  Good, excellent and then if this is not starting to get better, you know it has been a while.."
"147","  Call me, yup.  Come back.  If you start having chest pain, if you are getting more short of breath, if you start having a lot of like new gunky stuff like weird colors getting super duper stuffy sometimes after you have kind of a viral infection, you can get a bacterial infection and a sinus infection; it is not fun.  If you're having that like chest pain, coughing up gunk, you know, after a viral infection, you could also get something like a pneumonia, so it is just something to watch out for.  And if you are having like a high fever, then that's something you know, you would also want to just contact us."
"148","  Alright.  And then I also, when you are feeling a little bit better, I would love to have you in for just kind of a, you know, preventative care sort of visit because you are a healthy person.  I would really like to keep you that way.  So we can talk about the other things we recommend for a mature sophisticated, not old, gentleman like you, so..."
"149","  Make your _______"
"150","  We are preventing you from developing…"
"151","  Absolutely not."
"152","  It just means you appreciate a good deal."
"153","  Yeah.  I do.  Fun fact you can join at any age, you can join at 25."
"154","  Let the young people in your life know _______."
"155","  Absolutely, okay.  What questions do you have for me, Tom?"
"156","  Absolutely.  So COVID test, take it easy.  And come see me when you're feeling a little better, so we can work on the rest of it, good deal?"
"157","  Okay, thank you so much for coming and see me today.  It is a pleasure, I will call you."
"158","  It is my great pleasure."
"159","  You too."
"160","  (Laughs).  I am still here.  I know."
"161","  It is _______."
