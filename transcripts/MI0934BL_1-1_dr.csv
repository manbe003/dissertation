"1","  Hello.  Hello, can you hear me?  Helloo.  Hi there.  Can you hear me?  You can hear me?  Okay. Hi.  Hi, Freddie."
"2","  I can hear you, yes."
"3","  Okay.  That is all.  That is great.  My name is Leah.  I am going to be just asking you a few questions about how you are doing and so we could see if we could come up with a treatment plan for you.  How are you doing today?"
"4","  Trying to get who settled?"
"5","  Grandkids."
"6","  Okay.  Alright.  Well, are they all settled right now?"
"7","  Good to go, great.  Is this a good time for you to, to talk with me?"
"8","  Okay.  Can you tell me a little bit about how your overall health has been doing?"
"9","  Is that something that is new?"
"10","  Okay.  Would you say that something you, you have started paying attention to in the last few weeks, in the last few months, in the last few years?"
"11","  Two months maybe.  Okay, so you have been feeling tired.  So I know in your medical history it states that you have diabetes."
"12","  And that you are currently taking two medications for that?"
"13","  Metformin?"
"14","  Yes, good job.  Yeah.  Metformin and glipizide, have you been taking those medications?"
"15","  Once a week or?"
"16","  Once a week, okay."
"17","  Okay, that makes sense.  Are you taking any other medications?"
"18","  Um, how has your blood pressure been?"
"19","  So, so it has been pretty good."
"20","  So far, that is good.  So besides feeling tired, what else?  Anything else new that you have noticed in the past few weeks or past few months?"
"21","  That is mostly it.  Have you, have you noticed any changes to your sleep?"
"22","  Hmm.  Are you getting, how many hours of sleep are you getting at night?"
"23","  5 or 6, and currently are you employed anywhere?"
"24","  Working in construction, okay.  And then taking care of grandkids."
"25","  Yeah."
"26","  Has it, has it been overwhelming kind of managing both or?"
"27","  Hmm.  When did you start taking care of your grandkids?  How long has that been?"
"28","  Hmm."
"29","  Hmm.  But you think that is kind of what is making you, making you tired is the work and then also the taking care of."
"30","  But you think you should like this, is something before you would be able to handle."
"31","  Pretty well three months ago, four months ago."
"32","  Okay.  Do you know what your blood sugars have been in this period of time?"
"33","  Hmm.  Was that before you ate anything or after?"
"34","  Before breakfast, is that kind of what they have been the range that they have been running at?"
"35","  Hmm.  Okay, what, what has your blood sugar been?  I guess, do you, if you remember, like before your symptoms started, before the tiredness, do you remember?  No."
"36","  Have you ever been able to control your blood sugar to make it below 150 when you have been fasting?"
"37","  Okay, okay.  Thank you for sharing that.  All of this is really good information.  So I notice that in your, in your last few visits that you have had here, your hemoglobin A1c which is that one value that, yeah, that tracks your last three months of blood glucose."
"38","  Yeah, it has been kind of increasing, we generally like to see it under 7%.  "
"39","  Your last one was 7.9%.  So, yeah, I think I would want to get you back in here to check that value and see what it has been running or what the value is right now otherwise."
"40","  Yeah.  The last one I have is from about a year ago."
"41","  Yeah, but just kind of go back and see if anything else is going on, have you noticed any changes like any, besides fatigue, have you noticed any nausea, any vomiting?"
"42","  Is that to pee?"
"43","  To rest, okay.   So you have been you peeing more often? Does it wake you up at night that you have to go pee?"
"44","  Yeah, a lot more than, than before?"
"45","  Okay, okay.  So besides that, do you, have you noticed any changes to your stool? Like any diarrhea, any constipation?"
"46","  No?"
"47","  Regular."
"48","   Okay.  Have you noticed any smell in your urine? Like any fruity smell?"
"49","  Like has your urine, had a fruity smell or any like a sweet smell to it?"
"50","  That is okay, that is okay, if you do not know, that is okay, if you do not know."
"51","  Most people do not smell their urine after they go."
"52","  That would be very abnormal, but umm, sometimes it is just when people have very high blood sugars, that is something they just notice and it stands out to them."
"53","  And they are, yeah, because all the sugars coming out with the pee and so it just smells very sweet, so that is sometimes what patients notice but no worries if you are not smelling your urine, that is totally normal, but also something to watch out for."
"54","  Have you had any headaches?  Any dizziness?"
"55","  Just the tired!"
"56","  Any lightheadedness like you feel like you are going to pass out? No?"
"57","  Okay.  Well, it sounds like we have just two new things that you are dealing with is just the tiredness and the more frequent urination.  So you think what my next step or what my next plan would be for you is to check your, your blood hemoglobin A1c, just to see where we are we are at.  Your last one was 7.9, and then the year prior to that was 7.6, and then 7.4, 6.9, so it is kind of been slowly but surely climbing up a little bit."
"58","  Yeah.  And we generally like to see that number below 7.  That is kind of the goal if possible.  So I want to see that value and then I think at this point, if your blood sugars are running at around 200 or so, 200 you were saying right for before you eat breakfast, I would want to increase your dose of metformin to 1000 mg, so you are currently taking 500 mg, sorry, no, it is already maxed at that.  I think I would either want to increase the glipizide or add another medication and we can talk more about that when your results come back for your blood tests, yeah, because we want to see your blood sugar just a little bit lower, kind of in the lower hundreds before you eat, that is something that would be a goal for you."
"59","  Um, would you be able to come in to get your blood checked?"
"60","  Okay.  Yeah.  We can, we are very flexible; you can come in any time that you see fit, but do you want us to call you to arrange or?"
"61","  Okay."
"62","  Okay."
"63","  So I think on my end that is all I wanted to talk about.  Do you have any other questions for me or?"
"64","  So that depends on what your blood results show."
"65","  You know, we kind of want to see where we are at.  If your A1c comes back normal or within the normal range, then insulin might not be necessary.  How have you been doing in terms of your diet?"
"66","  Hmm.  What kind of foods do you eat?"
"67","  Hmm, hm."
"68"," Okay."
"69","  Okay, well, it is very good so.  What about in terms of sweets like drinks, like canned drinks, juice?"
"70","  Hmm.  What about a candy or desserts?"
"71","  Okay.  But other than that, it sounds like bread and potatoes, that kind of stuff is part of the diet."
"72","  Okay, well, another recommendation can be to, to try to decrease the intake of carbohydrates, which is just kind of like the starchy foods like that."
"73","  Goodâ€¦"
"74","  Yeah."
"75","  Yeah, it is very hard because you know, most people have been eating the same kind of food for their entire life and just making it, a drastic change is, is not that easy."
"76","  But, you know, but definitely taking steps in that direction would be, would be a good thing to do."
"77","  Um, any other questions that you have?"
"78","  Okay.  Well, we can go ahead and order that blood test and then check back in when we get the results to see what the next step should be."
"79","  Okay.  Thank you."
"80","  Yeah.  Thank you.  You are very welcome.  I hope you have a good rest of your day."
