"1","  Hello, Mr. Fredrick."
"2","  Mr. Fredrick, I can’t quite hear you."
"3","  Mr. Jones, I apologize.  If you can, I would have you click the mute button.  If you see it in the bottom on the left hand corner."
"4","  Yes, that’s great."
"5","  Hi and Mr. Jones I apologize, I was calling you Mr. Frederick."
"6","  Okay.  It can be complicated getting on Zoom, so I appreciate your patience than just kind of working through with me."
"7","  Have you ever done one of these telehealth visits before?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay. How are you doing today?"
"10","  Good.  I did review your chart but I would like to ask in my own words, what brings you in today for this visit."
"11","  Alright.  Yeah, I think it is great that you made the appointment.  Can you tell me a little more about when you feel tired?"
"12","  Okay.  What do you do for work, remind me?"
"13","  Okay.  How do you think your diabetes has been over the past year?"
"14","  Okay.  Is that when you are testing it yourself?"
"15","  Do you remember any of those numbers or just that it is in the yellow?"
"16","  Okay.  Was that before you ate anything?"
"17","  Okay.  What is the highest number you have seen in the past year?"
"18","  Okay.  Any change in your diet over the past year?"
"19","  Okay.  Just remind me, do you exercise at all, any sort of exercise routine?"
"20","  Excellent and about how many minutes you like to walk before with your wife."
"21","  Okay.  How do you feel during the walks?  Do you get tired during that time?"
"22","  Okay.  Any increased thirst?"
"23","  Any increased thirst or feeling like you just cannot drink enough water?"
"24","  Nothing different that years prior?"
"25","  Okay.  Any increase in the amount that you urinate, feeling like you have to run to the bathroom all the time?"
"26","  Any numbness or tingling in your fingers or toes?"
"27","  Okay.  Anything else that you think I should know that you might have been experiencing in the past year besides a little more fatigue or feeling tired?"
"28","  Okay.  Will you remind me, do you drink any alcohol?"
"29","  Okay.  Any current tobacco use, smoking or chewing?"
"30","  In the past any smoking or chewing?"
"31","  Okay.  Any illicit drug use?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  I do see in your chart here.  It looks like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or increased level of lipids and hypertension are those the things you deal with?"
"33","  Okay.  That might go along with the cholesterol what I said hyperlipidemia.  It can be a little complicated, so thank you, yes."
"34","  It’s okay.  The words are a little tough.  Any past surgeries?"
"35","  Your mom and dad, are they still alive?"
"36","  Okay.  Is your mom in good health or how would you classify her health?"
"37","  Okay.  What did your dad pass away from?"
"38","  Okay, okay.  "
"39","  I feel you, okay.  Any like diseases or any conditions that run in your family that might worry you?"
"40","  Okay.  For example, some people might have endocrine or cancer or things like that, any of that bring about?"
"41","  Okay.  Any bone pain?"
"42","  Okay okay.  What else do you think that I should know?  I know I asked if you are having any symptoms over the past year but is there anything else that you think I should know?"
"43","  One important thing I forgot to ask.  Are you taking any medications for your diabetes?  I see a couple of listed here."
"44","  Any issues taking those medications?"
"45","  Okay.  Most people have trouble remembering their medications once in a while.  Some people once a month, some people once a week.  Do you have any issues or how often do you think you forget?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Alright.  Any feelings like you might pass out, lightheadedness, or so?"
"48","  Any changes in your vision?"
"49","  Okay, alright.  Well, I think that is all I need for today and I do think it is important that we get your A1c checked."
"50","  Along with that, we will probably get a blood panel just general chemistry to make sure that all your electrolytes are in balance.  They can kind of give us a clue to make sure there is nothing else that is going on.  Okay."
"51","  What questions you have for me at this point?"
"52","  You know, it could be a portion.  There is a couple different answers here.  Okay, so it could be that your diabetes is not as well controlled that was used to be and we might need to look at changing your medications a little bit.  It might also be just kind of normal part of aging as we age.  We sometimes have a little less energy for things.  So that could be an explanation too.  There could also be something else going on.  That is unlikely, but I want to get that blood panel just to take a look and make sure that there is nothing else that we are missing."
"53","  Does that make sense?"
"54","  Alright, well, thank you Mr. Jones.  It was nice to see you today."
