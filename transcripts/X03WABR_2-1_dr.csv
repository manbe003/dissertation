"1","  Good morning.  Can you hear me?"
"2","  I'm doing good.  My name is Beng.  I'm a fourth year medical student at the University of Washington.  Can I get your name to confirm things?"
"3","  And how would you like to be called?"
"4","  Tom is good?  All right.  I read your charts, so I have an idea of what brings you in today, but I'd like to hear it from your own words as well?"
"5","  Tell me more about that?"
"6","  Okay.  Tell me what's been going on for the last five days."
"7","  Cough and tired yeah."
"8","  Cough, tired, feverish.  Any chest pains or anything else like that?  Headaches?"
"9","  Okay.  And have you been able to take your temperature at all?"
"10","  Okay, don't have a thermometer, okay.  Like just feel like maybe kind of hot?"
"11","  Are you sweating a lot?"
"12","  Okay, have you been around anyone else that's sick?"
"13","  No one else that's sick, at all?"
"14","  Okay.  And so main concern is obviously with the pandemic going on is, could this be COVID or not?"
"15","  Yeah, have you got the vaccines at all?"
"16","  Okay, so she got the vaccine but you currently haven’t gotten it."
"17","  Eligible?  Okay, yeah, it is with how things are scheduled, it is definitely difficult to get the shots."
"18","  Yeah, yeah."
"19","  What do you do for work?"
"20","  And then how often you work, are you around other people when you work, or?"
"21","  Mainly outdoors, okay.  How good are the social distancing precautions, like are you all crammed together or you can space out a little bit more?"
"22","  Okay.  And have you had anything else like vomiting, diarrhea, anything like that?"
"23","  Okay and nothing and not during these episodes, but before these things?"
"24","  Okay.  So it's not out of the norm for you?"
"25","  You had diarrhea, okay, are you having any skin rashes or anything like that?"
"26","  No skin rashes, okay.  And have you noticed any other symptoms like chills, pains that's abnormal for you, muscle aches, anything like that?"
"27","  Okay.  And then just mainly this cough and fatigue, your main symptoms?  Yeah, no, no changes to your taste or anything else like that, right?"
"28","  Okay, all right.  And let's see, you mentioned no one is sick, no other sick contacts that you know of and otherwise doing pretty well."
"29","  Okay, haven’t been to a doctor in 10 years.  Well, there are few things that I'm thinking about from what you're telling me with the global pandemic that's going on could this be COVID? Based on just the way our conversation, I can't say for sure whether it is or isn’t.  I think getting testing is pretty simple nowadays with all the places that you can go to get a quick test.  They stick a swab in your nose and you'll have the results pretty fast.  I do recommend you get testing to make sure that this isn’t COVID and that you're not sick or you could potentially spread it to someone else.  Is that something?"
"30","  So there's lots of places; lot of places like Rite Aid will have testing.  Most of the hospitals will have testing.  Lots of clinics will have testing as well but even local places like Rite Aid often offers testing."
"31","  Yes for testing all the COVID related stuff and from my understanding testing for the most part should be free."
"32","  So that should be that or if you just call them, show them your insurance it should be free from my understanding and then you should get the results back pretty fast."
"33","  Yeah.  So I recommend you do get tested for the results for that.  In the meantime, you know, try to social distance the best you can.  When is the next time you have to go to work?"
"34","  Okay.  When is the next time you have to go back to work?"
"35","  Okay, towards the end of the week.  So today is Wednesday.  If you are able to get testing, how good is your work about accommodating things like COVID?"
"36","  Yeah, yeah.  So I do recommend you call one of them.  I'll give you a list of things later.  I'll send the messages to you.  Call one of those to schedule testing to make sure you don't have COVID.  And then depending on whether what the results are, you can, I should be able, you should just send a message to me and then we can work on the next steps after that once we get the results."
"37","  I do recommend you know while waiting for things just mask up to make sure we don't spread COVID and try to social distance and not going out to avoid spreading if you do have it."
"38","  Any other questions for me at this moment?"
"39","  Yeah.  I did want to touch up on that."
"40","  I did want to touch up on that while, because you did mention, I was going to at the end of the visit, since you haven’t seen a doctor for 10 years, I do recommend we set up ___ getting you a primary care physician."
"41","  I mean, I honestly wish we could, but this appointment slot that I'm given is not enough time for a full primary care visit.  So I do recommend you reschedule an actual primary care intake appointment, so we can actually sort out all the issues that you may have."
"42","  May or may not have."
"43","  For the initial intake, it will probably take somewhere between 30 to 45 minutes and then if you're healthy will see you once a year after that."
"44","  Some of the clinics do have weekend slots, but I think most are during the weekdays.  I'll try to set you up with somebody that can get you a weekend slot."
"45","  Yeah, Tom.  It's definitely understandable that you don't want to miss any work for your appointments.  We'll try to accommodate you the best time that we can with what we have, that at the same time also it's your health and it's very important that we do, you know, you seem like a healthy guy and you want to stay healthy and that's our goal for you as well.  So we'll, that's something that we can, we should work on as well, we can send you doctor's notes if you need it for your work to come to these annual appointments or and we'll try to work out other ways, whatever we can to accommodate you."
"46","  Does that sound good?"
"47","  Okay.  Well, I'll let the scheduler know that you want to be put on a schedule for a primary care appointment intake and then like I said, we'll do the primary appointment and we'll see kind of where the results are after that and if you're all checked out and everything looks good we'll probably see you once a year."
"48","  And then we'll both go from there.  And then first things first, so you've got to go get, call those numbers that I'm going to send you and let's check out your, see if you have COVID or not and then we can work from that, right?"
"49","  All right, Tom, do you have any other questions for me?"
"50","  All right, cool.  So in the meantime mask up, wash your hands, try to stay away from other people until we get this, at least until we get these results.  Okay?"
"51","  All right.  Have a good day Tom.  You can go now."
