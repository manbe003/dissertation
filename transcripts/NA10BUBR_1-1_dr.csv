"1","  Hi there.  Oh, I think you might still be unmute, I still can’t hear you. I think you are still unmute.  Do you see, there should be on your Zoom screen on the bottom left there should be like a mute button."
"2","  Oh, perfect, I can hear you now."
"3","  How are you?  Are you Mr. Freddie?"
"4","  Mr. Jones, nice to meet you.  I am Sangita."
"5","  I am going to be your medical provider kind of taking care of you this visit.  It is nice to meet Mr. Jones.  Do you prefer that I call you Mr. Jones?"
"6","  Freddie, okay, all right.  Okay, so I kind of I looked at your chart, I know a little bit about you, but I would love to hear kind of what your goals are for today’s visit and what things you would like to talk about?"
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Worned out, okay, yeah that sounds great.  Well we are really glad that you have come in to see us, so why don’t we start maybe kind of talking about how the last year has been for you healthwise and you mentioned you have type II diabetes I would love to hear a little bit more about kind of what have been doing for that over this last year and how you feel like things have been going."
"10","  Open ended.  I’ll ask you more specific questions if you prefer but."
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Okay."
"14","  Sure.  Yeah that’s a really great question, so I am getting the sense that you are maybe feeling a little bit more fatigued when you get home in the evenings, is that correct?"
"15","  And what do you do for work."
"16","  Okay, okay.  And how long do you feel like you’ve just kind of been feeling more tired when you get home from work, how long has it been going on?"
"17","  All right, yeah."
"18","  Okay."
"19","  Okay, okay, so I am hearing a couple of things, I am hearing one thing that is you are maybe concerned about is just overall feeling a little bit less energetic that’s been kind of gradual for some time now."
"20","  And then second thing that I am hearing that maybe you are concerned about is your blood sugar levels and kind of what’s going on with your diabetes, is that correct?"
"21","  Okay, so I definitely think it is really important that we address both things today, we can talk more in detail about both things, but kind of going back to the fatigue that you’ve been feeling, can you tell me a little bit more about what that feels like for you.  I know fatigue can mean different things for different people, but does it mean that do you like get short of breath ever or is it just that like you feel like you have less energy and you feel like you need to sleep more in the evenings, can you tell me a little more about it?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay."
"24","  Sure."
"25","  Yeah, I am sure having kinds in the house can be pretty tiring."
"26","  Yeah.  No, does that sound, that sounds hard.  Do you ever experience, are you having any other symptoms like any unexpected fevers, any like weight loss, like unintentional weight loss that you’ve noticed?"
"27","  Okay, what about like any shortness of breath or chest pain?"
"28","  Okay, okay.  Any headaches at all?"
"29","  Okay.  So overall everything seems to be going well besides kind of this just feeling like a loss of energy?"
"30","  Okay.  Okay and what does a lot mean to you, how many times?"
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Okay.  Do you have like any burning sensation with peeing?"
"33","  No, okay.  Any blood in your urine that you’ve noticed?"
"34","  Okay, good.  Okay, and all right, I think those are all my questions regarding that.  And then you had mentioned kind of your blood sugars and your A1c level, can you tell me a little bit more about how taking medications has gone for you over this last year, are you still taking your medications or?"
"35","  Okay."
"36","  And how often do you miss a dose if at all?"
"37","  Every couple of weeks, okay.  So it sounds like you are pretty good about taking your medications and it sounds like you check your blood sugars at home, is that correct?"
"38","  Couple of times a week and what numbers have you been seeing when you are checking your blood sugars at home?"
"39","  215 this morning, okay.  All right, okay and then any like numbness or tingling in your toes or your fingers at all?"
"40","  Sorry you had what, I didn’t get it?"
"41","  Okay that’s gotten better."
"42","  Okay, okay.  All right, and then do you take any medications for like your blood pressure or anything like that?  I know you take, it sounds like you take metformin and glipizide for your diabetes.  Do you take anything for blood pressure?"
"43","  Okay, no, all right.  Okay that sounds good.  I think those are couple of other questions that I have right now.  Is there anything else that you can think of that’s important for me to know about you or your help before we continue to talk about things about like plan and stuff like that?"
"44","  Yeah, no, that sounds great.  So I think you know like you mentioned it has been quite some time since we last were able to like kind of check routine blood work, so I think that’s a really good place to start, to kind of just get a sense of where you are at with your diabetes management and also just do some other tests to check like a metabolic panel and check your blood counts just to make sure that everything looks okay and then with regard to kind of this loss of energy that you are experiencing and fatigue, it’s really tough to know like people experience fatigue for lots of different reasons.  It sounds like you have a little bit, you’ve had some changes in your life and or having, like you are spending more time with your grandkids which can sometimes contribute to feeling tired, but of course like you had mentioned like age can also be a contributing factor as well.  But nonetheless I think that this is something that you’ve been noticing for some times, I think it makes sense to do these labs and see if there is anything that we can see that might be contributing to your fatigue, so I would like to get that A1c to check your diabetes, I would like to get a metabolic panel and I would like to get blood count and also check your thyroid as well if that’s okay with you."
"45","  Okay.  And then I would like to just like follow-up with you in a week or so and we can just do another like televisit to kind of talk about treatment options for if anything comes up."
"46","  Okay.  And then your A1c, you know, I know like I think under 8 is a good goal, ideally we would like it to be a little bit lower, so how about we see what’s going on with it this time and then we can think about if we need to add any medications if that’s something that you are open to?"
"47","  It sounds okay with you, okay, all right.  Is there anything else that you want to address at today’s visit that I am not addressing or that you would like to talk about some more?"
"48","  Okay, all right.  I also want to ask you as I didn’t ask these questions earlier and I just thought about it, but how has like your mood been lately?"
"49","  Okay and how much sleep do you normally get on like a regular basis?"
"50","  Six, seven hours, okay, okay all right.  Okay, I think those are all my questions for today.  So I am going to put in those orders for those labs and you can just go down to the lab and get them done and then I’ll see the results and then if it is okay, I would like to setup an appointment for in another week to see you again, would that be okay?"
"51","  Okay, all right, well it was really nice meeting you Freddie."
"52","  You are welcome.  Feel free to sign off the call now."
"53","  Have a good day."
