"1","  Hello, how are you?"
"2","  I actually cannot see you."
"3","  No."
"4","  Ah, there we go.  Hello Mr. Jones, how are you?"
"5","  I am okay.  My name is Sheila.  I am a fourth year medical student.  Is it all right if I chart with you a little bit about what’s going on?"
"6","  So I understand that you are coming in today for kind of a routine visit for your diabetes.  Is that true?  Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about today?"
"7","  Yeah, we can definitely do that.  So you said that it’s been a little bit longer since the last time that you got tracked for you diabetes, what’s kind of being going on that prevented you from doing that?"
"8","  Okay.  So I guess how was – how do you feel like your diabetes management has been going?"
"9","  Okay, so getting a little bit more tired?  Uhh."
"10","  And how kind of recently did that start, has it been around last year, last few months, last week or so?"
"11","  Hmmm, okay.  And when you say it’s fatigue, is it like you have to stop and sit down and just like rest after just walking a few blocks or like what is the nature of the fatigue for you?"
"12","  Hmmm.  Okay."
"13","  And have you noticed any like shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?"
"14","  Okay, any chest pain or pressure?"
"15","  Okay, alright, so it sounds like general kind of tiredness."
"16","  Have you noticed any like muscle weakness or pain or cramping that kind of thing?"
"17","  Alright.  So I see that we got some labs done recently for you."
"18","  So your most recent A1c was 7.9."
"19","  And your – that’s like the highest that it’s been kind of from the measures that I have."
"20","  Do you feel like that sounds about right to you from?"
"21","  Okay, alright.  And are you, have you been able to check your glucose levels regularly?"
"22","  Okay, okay, and what have your sugars been?"
"23","  Okay.  Well that was before or after you ate?"
"24","  Okay, okay and is that like average for you over the last few months or…?"
"25","  Yeah.  Okay, alright and right now it looks like you are taking metformin 500 mg twice a day and glipizide 10 mg twice a day?"
"26","  And how often do you feel like you are able to take your medications?"
"27","  Oh, okay, okay.  So it sounds like your missing maybe a few doses."
"28","  Okay, how many would you say like on a weekly basis you miss?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Okay, okay, so like once every two weeks, alright.  And have you noticed any kind of side effects from the medications or have you tolerated them?"
"31","  Alright, let’s see.  Okay, I also note in my chart that you have had some difficulty standing recently?"
"32","  Okay, so you are not having any tingling in your hands or your feet or anything like that?"
"33","  Okay, alright.  And do you do kind of the regular diabetes foot check?"
"34","  Yeah, so for people with diabetes sometimes there is an increased risk of kind of what you are talking about the tingling, so we call that neuropathy and so sometimes when people aren’t necessarily feeling as well in their feet they might you know are more likely to step on something and you know get a wound that gets infected because they can’t really feel it."
"35","  And are more prone to infection and so kind of checking your feet regularly is something that we recommend for people with diabetes."
"36","  Yeah, just to prevent kind of worst outcomes in the case of like fungus or infection or you know wounds or that kind of things."
"37","  But it’s good to hear that you haven’t really been experiencing the neuropathy."
"38","  That is a concern just kind of given your rising A1cs and so you know goal would be to kind of get that back to, get that, get that down."
"39","  Within a healthy range.  Okay and then have you had any kind of chills, night sweats, fevers, abdominal pain, how is everything else going?"
"40","  Okay and when do you notice when you are urinating more frequently, is it painful when you are urinating?"
"41","  Okay."
"42","  Okay, any discoloration, any blood in your urine?"
"43","  Any cloudy urine?"
"44","  Okay so that could be related to your diabetes.  How do you feel like your diet has been?"
"45","  I am glad.  Hahaha….What do you say you like eat on a regular basis?"
"46","  Uh huh."
"47","  That sounds very yummy."
"48","  Yeah, okay, okay.  So if…ummm…I guess how do you feel about I don’t know if anybody has ever talked to you about like diet or kind of using diet as a tool to help manage your diabetes and like you know high cholesterol and that kind of thing?"
"49","  Uh huh."
"50","  Yeah, so it sounds like in terms of what you described as your diet there a few meals that I may be concerned a little bit about in terms of maybe the like fat content and sugar content.  So like you mentioned that for lunch you go to McDonald’s pretty regularly."
"51","  And then you mentioned the kind of steak and potatoes for dinner regularly."
"52","  So yeah, those are just like a few things I am thinking about and I know those are important parts of you know life and your wife is cooking and so maybe you have a little bit less control, but I am sure they are delicious, but kind of thinking about incorporating more like fruits and vegetables into your diet or just like more grains, may be less red meat, less fatty foods.  Do you feel like that’s something that you are interested in kind of embarking on, kind of what are your thoughts about changing parts of your diet at least?"
"53","  I guess thinking through what you feel like would be most manageable for you since you said that you don’t cook and it sounds like for lunch that you are having like you are eating out regularly."
"54","  Is there a way to maybe like make a meal at home and bring to work like a salad or something like that."
"55","  Okay, and that’s you know a conversation we can keep having.  I don’t know if we have a dietitian in our clinic, but if we do I would recommend you know you could chat with them as well."
"56","  Yeah, that’s one kind of aspect of this.  Another is your medications, so right now you are on metformin and glipizide and I don’t know if you’ve ever had a conversation about insulin, is that something that you’ve thought about or people told you about."
"57","  Okay yeah, I hear you.  Yeah, insulin can be a big step for people to kind of manage.  Okay, so I guess kind of coming from your perspective what do you feel like has been one of the primary barriers in because it seems like your A1c has been kind of slowly creeping up."
"58","  So like what do you feel like has been kind of a barrier to keeping it at a level that would be maybe a little bit more favorable?"
"59","  Aging okay.  Anything else you feel like."
"60","  That is very true."
"61","  One thing we could also think about is bringing your wife into the next kind of meeting if you are okay with that, you know, talking to her about some of these things."
"62","  Okay, so it sounds like you are against insulin and you like your kind of current regimen.  I think something we could maybe do is increase the dose of your glipizide.  I have to check to see what the kind of next dose would be, but that could be a potential."
"63","  Yeah, so glipizide is a medication that helps to kind of lower your blood glucose levels."
"64","  It’s like working kind of like metformin, but they are working in concert."
"65","  To kind of control your blood glucose levels kind of normal."
"66","  So that’s something we could do.  I think you might be at the maximum dose of metformin I have to check, but I think we can work with the glipizide as one step and then maybe think about switching to a different medication if that’s not really working before we like ever kind of talk about insulin again though if the blood glucose does keep kind of creeping up that’s really something that would be effective."
"67","  But I know it’s something that you don’t want to really think about right now."
"68","  So you are asked to kind of working on the diet and then trying to exercise as much as you can.  I do think that helping with your blood glucose might help with the fatigue as well, but yeah, actually I like to hear a little bit more about that, so it sounds like you just get really tired when you are walking, but you don’t have any chest pain, you don’t have any shortness of breath, you just kind of have to sit down and take a rest."
"69","  And this has been going on for a few months.  Okay, and then was there anything else you wanted to talk about today I guess how do you feel about what we’ve talked about, what a potential plan might be moving forward?"
"70","  Okay, good.  So how about we do that and then I would hope to see you back again pretty soon and then keep kind of checking your glucose levels."
"71","  And if next time you could bring like a maybe like a sheet if you can like maybe right now that would be really helpful to take a look at and then I’ll look into the dosing for those medications and see if we can increase the dose on that if we have some little room with the glipizide.  It looks like your last colorectal cancer screening, oh maybe you didn’t have one, but the last time we talked about, it was in 2011."
"72","  Okay, is that something that you would be interested in talking about again?"
"73","  Or, yeah the last time it was talked about I don’t know."
"74","  Okay."
"75","  Yeah, that’s what I have heard as well, I have never had one."
"76","  Yeah, but it’s you know, it’s a good preventative kind of method."
"77","  So that’s something that I can like put in a referral for because you are kind of in age that would…."
"78","  And you know finding anything kind of sooner is better than later so."
"79","  Yeah, we could put in a referral for that as well."
"80","  Okay, how does that sound?"
"81","  Okay.  Hopefully it is not that unpleasant.  Hahaha…."
"82","  I have not."
"83","  Alright, let’s not say anything about that."
"84","  Yeah.  Okay, well it was nice to see you and I think you can click on the leave button and I think you’ll get like an after-visit summary of everything we’ve talked about with the like kind of next steps written out for you."
"85","  Okay."
"86","  Okay, sounds good."
"87","  Bye."
"88","  I think you can just click on the red button, leave button at the very right, bottom right hand side."
"89","  Okay."
