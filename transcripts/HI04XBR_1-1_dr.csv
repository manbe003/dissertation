"1","  Hi, Mr. Johnson?"
"2","  Hi, I am Fernanda, you know, will be one of your providers today helping out."
"3","  So, I can see why you came in, but I want to hear from you what’s going on and what brings you in today?"
"4","  You got cold, okay.  When did that start?"
"5","  Five days.  Can you tell me a little bit more about this cold and how you’re maybe feeling?"
"6","  Yeah, okay.  So, for five days, would you say that it’s been getting better, worse or about the same?"
"7","  Okay and have you taken anything for this cold?"
"8","  Okay and has that helped at all?"
"9","  Cough, okay and tell me about your cough, is it a dry or wet cough?"
"10","  Okay like what, have you ever noticed blood in your cough?"
"11","  Okay, okay, what color would you say that your phlegm is when you do cough?"
"12","  Off-white, okay and has that been the same throughout your five days?"
"13","  Okay, have you had any other symptoms with this besides the cold, feeling crummy?"
"14","  Okay.  Any fevers or chills?"
"15","  Let just say you feel kind of hot to the touch."
"16","  Okay.  Have you had any headache?"
"17","  Any shortness of breath?"
"18","  Chest pain?"
"19","  And has anybody else like you said you have a girlfriend, did she feel the same also kind of sick and crummy?"
"20","  Have you been exposed to anyone that might be sick?"
"21","  Okay, okay, great.  And have any had any upset stomach or GI problems?"
"22","  Like any stomach cramps or stomach pain, upset stomach things like that?"
"23","  That’s a good question though.  For GI, I say gastrointestinal."
"24","  Yeah, that’s a good question, any loss of taste or smell?"
"25","  And from I just want to clarify you don’t know if you have been around anyone that has COVID before?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","  Yeah, yeah."
"28","  So, feels like it has like a bunch of wide range of symptoms.  So, I am glad that you came in for a checkup."
"29","  Have you ever had it before?"
"30","  Yeah."
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Right, yeah.  Do you have any medical problems?"
"33","  Gotcha!  Okay.  Well, I am glad that you are in here today."
"34","  So, it does sound like you have like significant cold symptoms, I am not sure whether I would say it is just a flu or just any sort of regular virus or if it is COVID, but we could do a nasal swab today if you wanted to?"
"35","  Yeah."
"36","  Yeah."
"37","  Have you ever had any sort of COVID test like a nasal swab before?"
"38","  It sounds like it would be like a big process, but there are some centers that can be really quickly some there is even drive-up centers.  So, you don’t have to get out of your car and it’s really, it’s a very quick test.  So, normally it’s just your little nasal swab on both nostrils and it takes a few seconds and then the reports can be back within 24 or 72 hours depending on what the testing center is, but it can be barely, fairly simple test to do."
"39","  Yeah.  Well, I want to take those into your heart, in your lungs make sure that all sounds okay, would that be okay with you?"
"40","  I guess to Brooklyn.  I guess when we’re done with this, I am going to have a nurse come in and take a listen to your heart and lungs."
"41","  Have you had any, you said you didn’t have any shortness of breath, is that correct?"
"42","  And any wheezing?"
"43","  Okay, what do you do for work?"
"44","  Okay, is that at mall or?"
"45","  Okay and do you work with other people then?"
"46","  Yeah and when is the last time that you went to work?"
"47","  Monday.  What day today is?"
"48","  Okay, okay."
"49","  Well, especially if you’re telling me that you are working with other people also, it might be good to get this test, that way it prevents like if you do have COVID let’s say it will help prevent the spread of it to your coworkers and that way you just feel very sure that you can go to work without getting other people sick or you know being more-sick yourself."
"50","  Well, you can definitely think about it, but there is certainly many, many options that won’t take that much time and depending on where you live we can find good location that’s near you."
"51","  That’s all for now, do you have any questions for me?"
"52","  Yeah, well, I think you did great, but this is mostly for like a checkup into little over your concerns so I guess in this case part of your girlfriend’s concerns too.  So, it’s just pretty much an open space that you can ask any questions right now?"
"53","  Okay."
"54","  Yeah, well in the meantime if for some reason these cold symptoms don’t go away, I want you to encourage you know get lots of rest, drink a lots of fluid and in the meantime while you’re still having these symptoms avoid any interaction with other people.  So, you don’t get them sick or you know it just makes the spread of whatever you have it maybe a common virus or the flu anything like that could make it worse."
"55","  Okay."
"56","  Yeah, well depending on even if you work with other people or anybody _________ you know just while you’re having these symptoms, I encourage you to just kind of stay indoors and limit your exposure to other people, okay."
"57","  If for some reason you could get thermometer also to measure your temperature, do you have one at home?"
"58","  Okay, you could also have you know you could try something like Amazon, have you ever tried ordering anything from there?"
"59","  Yeah, they could ship it to your house and you know that could also help prevent you from going to the grocery store that’s another thought or you can try to take your temperature and if for some reason your temperature is like consistently really high like above let say like 101 or 102 consistently and you’re having shortness of breath and the mucus isn’t really going away, I would encourage you to either call me back or at that point go to your local emergency room, okay."
"60","  It looks like everything is pretty stable."
"61","  Just to be sure those are some things you could do, okay, okay.  Thank you so much for visiting with me too, Mr. Johnson."
"62","  It was good to meet you."
