"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Hey!  How are you doing?"
"3","  Good.  Mr. Jones, is how you prefer to go by?"
"4","  Okay.  Awesome.  I am Dr. Mozaffari or you can call me Sheila, whichever you prefer.  So, I have your chart here, but if you don't mind just telling me a little bit about your increasing fatigue that you have been experiencing these last few months."
"5","  Yeah."
"6","  Yeah and so, you are just feeling more fatigued and also said that you are having trouble standing.  Is that from the fatigue or you are having pain in your feet or can you describe that for me?"
"7","  Okay.  So, standing."
"8","  Got it."
"9","  Got it, okay, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your limbs?"
"10","  No, so looking at your chart, it seems as though the last time we checked your A1c was about a year ago.  Does that sound right to you?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Yeah.  Have you been taking your prescribed medication as prescribed?"
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  Okay."
"15","  Okay, so taking both the metformin and the glipizide?"
"16","  Okay and I wanted to ask, I had noticed on your chart, it says you are diagnosed with hyperlipidemia historically.  Does that sound right to you?"
"17","  Yeah."
"18","  Okay.  Yeah.  So, I noticed that was on your list but it does not look like you have been taking any medications prescribed for that as of now.  Sometimes you are prescribed what we call as statin for that.  It helps lower your cholesterol levels and your lipids in your blood.  It helps to treat the hyperlipidemia.  So, that could be something that we look into as well if you are interested in that or if that is something that you would be open to doing?"
"19","  Statins?"
"20","  Oh, not typically but having hyperlipidemia can lead to higher risk of heart disease later in life, so it is just something that we like to kind of proactively prevent."
"21","  Yeah, so that was just something I wanted to bring up since I did notice it.  As for the fatigue, so it did, so your A1c that we had measured a year ago was at 7.9% and I don't know how well counseled you’ve been on A1c levels historically, but that is a bit on the higher side than we would like."
"22","  Yeah, have you, you know, it was a year ago the last time you checked it or do you know if it has been checked by you or anyone else within the last year."
"23","  Okay, okay.  So that’s slightly high as well, not terrible but just a little higher than we would like.  So, I do not know you are able to, obviously we are doing a telehealth for a reason, it’s a little more convenient but if you were, if you are able to, I think what we, what I would like for us to do is have you come in and we can get your A1c measured.  It’s just, is good to have that measured frequently, so we can kind of know what the average blood sugar has been over the past three months."
"24","  Obviously, it’s great that you’ve been taking your medication, but I think that if we can measure your A1c and see if it is a bit higher than we would like.  We can look to altering your medication regimen to maybe something that will, something that is little more aggressive that will help lower those blood sugar levels, because 7.9 which was last year that is like I said a little high and having a high blood sugar can result in that increased fatigue, so if you’ve been, experience even more increasing fatigue these past couple of months it could be because of your high blood sugar and so I think getting that measured and potentially altering your medication regimen could be a place that we start."
"25","  Okay and then maybe when you come in as well we can also talk about potentially starting a statin for the hyperlipidemia as well."
"26","  Okay.  Do you have access to transportation?  Is that something you would be willing to come in and get seen."
"27","  Yeah, okay.  Well I, what I can do is I can send you a link to our schedule and you can choose what day and time works best for your schedule and your availability to drive in and come on in."
"28","  Whatever works best for you, we would be happy to, yeah, work within your schedule to make that happen but I do think, yeah, it would be important that you come in and we get that measured and kind of alter your plan a little bit."
"29","  Okay.  Is there anything else that you are wanting to talk about with me today?"
"30","  Yeah, no it’s definitely something to, it’s good that you are aware, aware of your bodily functions, of your energy levels, your, I think that is really important.  I think making an appointment with me was the right call and I think once we can get your A1c measured that will give us a better idea as to what is, what is going on."
"31","  Great, okay, well if there is anything else that you want to talk about today, feel free to hop off and I will hopefully see you later this week."
"32","  Awesome."
"33","  Thank you Mr. Jones.  Have a good day."
