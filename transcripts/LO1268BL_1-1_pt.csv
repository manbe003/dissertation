"1","  Hello, I just found the mute button here, so we could get started.  How are you doing today?"
"2","  Oh well.  I'm pretty good, I guess. I'm just tired all the time."
"3","  One of the main reasons I'm coming in or well, I'm not coming in there, that's why we're talking here."
"4","   This is strange doing everything on TV."
"5","  Well, I know I'm supposed to have you check on my diabetes every four months or so, and normally I do that, but for the last year, I've just kind of taken that off, so it's been a while.  I want to take care of my health and take care of my diabetes, so wanting to get things rolling again after that.  This is the last year that we're all going to try to forget."
"6","  Oh well, it seems like in a lot of ways, you know, it's going according to plan.  I take my meds, the metformin and the glipizide and everything pretty regularly and. let's see.  Well, the main thing is I'm just tired all the time and I'm really kind of worried about being able to keep up with my grandkids these days.  It is just like bundles of energy that.  Well, normally my wife will take care of them at home, but when I get home, I really love to play with them.  But by the time I get home at the end of a work day, I'm pretty much toast and so is it just because I'm getting old?  I mean, am I going to die or what?  I mean, I figure it's just.  Umm, well, I don't know that's the way it is."
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Oh, I take those everyday, the twice a day for the metformin and the glipizide once a day."
"9","  Well.  I'm pretty good about taking it most days.  Maybe every couple of weeks I'll forget a day alright, so."
"10","  I'm trying to stay on a good steady diet and my wife is a great cook and I'm not going to start giving her instructions on how to do her job you know, it's.  But exercise, I've been walking more.  I don't always get a chance to get a walk because I'm always in one of our facilities, walking around if I'm not in the office, so I get a lot of walk in but if I can, I'll try to get a walk once or twice a week and you get a little exercise that way."
"11","  It's not so much that I'm more tired when I'm walking, it's just that I feel like I ought to be doing something else that's more constructive walking around. I mean, nothing's happening, so I could be doing a lot of things in the office if I wasn't out strolling around the neighborhood, so I just feel kind of impatient about it.  Does that make sense?"
"12","  I don't know.  It seems to, sometimes I'll take a nap after a meal that would give me a little chance to catch up on things, so I don’t know, I can't pin down an exact time I guess, but umm, it's not so much what time of day it is that I get tired.  It's just like I got this tired feeling all the time and I get that more often now than I used to, I guess."
"13","  Not particularly, I guess.  First, I'm worried about which tests I have to do.  The blood test and get my meds, and so, I forget, what was the question again."
"14","  Oh, no, not particularly."
"15","  Okay, I get 6 or 7 hours a night.  That's usually pretty much. I mean, that's usually enough for me."
"16","  No."
"17","  No."
"18","  Oh, pretty good for the most part.  I haven't been particularly worried or anxious about anything lately, so I guess my mood is pretty good."
"19","  Those things are true.  I don't know.  I just figured that's just a natural part of aging and that's the way it is as I get older, you know, so I hit 60 this year and so far it doesn't seem that different than 59, but umm, anyway."
"20","  Yeah, may be.  I think my main interest, I'm less interested in vacations and work and all that stuff.  I really love spending time with my family, especially my grandkids, and so that's maybe where my anxiety comes in, as wanting to make the time that I have with them.  You know, valuable time so that I'm not just snoring away in the background while somebody else takes care of them."
"21","  Well, I guess so.  You know, as we get older we probably all do that, but mostly what I'm worried about is being able to manage my diabetes in a way that lets me do the things I want to do with my family.  But I'm kind of worried about getting on the insulin track.  I don't want to get to that stage and so I am looking for other ways to manage things so that I don't have to take that step."
"22","  Yeah, a year ago, I guess it was about 7.479 is a little bit higher, but as long as I'm under 8 , you know, I figure that's a good thing, right?"
"23","  Well, I guess so. I mean, I can give that a try.  I'm pretty busy management.  So they've always got somebody coming up with a problem.  I got to deal with them, but if I can get that time to do that, that'd be great."
"24","  Yeah.  Well, it gets complicated when the younger they are. I mean, they're 8, 6 and 2, I guess."
"25","  Well.  Taking a 2-year-old out on walk, it means you get to just basically carry around for the most of the time, I guess Ellis is 5 and Megan is 8, so maybe the older ones, so maybe if, well, my wife could take care of Lisa, the younger one, maybe while I take the older ones out and maybe that would be a way to do it.  Yeah, that's a good idea."
"26","  The kids' mom works and that's why they stay with their granny basically and she takes care of them and then when she's not doing that, I take care of them."
"27","  Great."
"28","  Sure."
"29","  Yeah definitely."
"30","  Sounds good to me. Yeah, sure."
"31","  Umm. Maybe I'll talk to her and see what she has to say about that, yeah."
"32","  Okay."
"33","  That makes sense, yeah."
"34","  Hmm.  I get depressed sometimes. Not like normal thing, no."
"35","  No, it's not really me."
"36","  Sure."
"37","  Hmm.  I can't think of any.  If we set up that time for those tests and stuff, it sounds like we're on track to pick things up and get things moving, so…"
"38","  Can't think of a specific question right now, sorry."
"39","  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that'd be good."
"40","  Fantastic. Well, Leah."
"41","  Thanks Leah for your time."
"42","  You too."
