"1","  Hey, how are you?"
"2","  Good.  Do you go by Freddie?"
"3","  Hi, I'm Alex.  I am a medical student at University of Washington and so what brings you in today?"
"4","  Okay, yeah, yeah, I was reviewing your chart and your - it appears that your A1c has gone up a little bit.  Do you - can you tell me a little bit what you, what information you know about the A1c and like what number it should be around?"
"5","  Yeah, yeah, definitely, I can see why you would want to keep up with your grandkids for sure.  Since you, so it's about a year since you had your last A1c check, you know, it was 7.6 at that time, have you noticed any changes in your diet or have any thoughts on what could have caused the increase in your A1c?"
"6","  Yeah, yeah definitely.  And are you -- do you check your blood sugars at home at all?"
"7","  What have they been at home?"
"8","  Okay, okay.  Has that been what they've been like recently, have you noticed they increased more in the past like couple of months?"
"9","  Okay.  You're still taking the metformin and glipizide?"
"10","  Any adverse reactions with those like upset stomach, diarrhea?"
"11","  Okay.  You were saying that you've been pretty fatigued and tired recently.  Can you tell me a little bit about that?"
"12","  Okay.  Have you noticed any difficulties with sleeping?"
"13","  Okay.  Has your wife or anyone else ever told you, you snored?"
"14","  Okay, okay.  And have you noticed any like shortness of breath?"
"15","  What about swelling in your legs?"
"16","  And I mean like, palpitations and feeling like your heart is racing?"
"17","  Okay.  Well, like I'm concerned that the increased blood sugars are what's causing your low energy.  Your body doesn’t have to do so much work to be able to keep up with such high blood sugar levels.  So, I say a couple options that we have would be increasing your glipizide so increasing that dose to see if that will help control your blood sugars a little bit better and see if that improves your energy and then also have you ever been to a dietitian or someone to help with the diabetic diet?"
"18","  Would you be interested in that?"
"19","  Yeah, I can definitely put in a referral to get that set up and when you have time available get that scheduled and just have someone to talk to about the diet aspects, because that, that can be little things that are hidden, and, that we don't even know about that can sometimes increase blood sugars, so look at that.  And then when you got your A1c done, did they do a full panel for bloodwork or is it just the A1c?"
"20","  Okay, so they got all the labs, okay.  Okay, sounds good.  What are your thoughts on next steps?"
"21","  Okay, sounds good.  I think then increasing that glipizide dose and then putting in the referral for a dietitian and you just go in whenever you have time available is a good next step.  And then we will followup in three months, recheck that A1c and in that time I'd also like you to keep like a diary journal of your blood sugars, so for whenever you take them if it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, most of the time like a fasting, one in the morning is best, but take that.  And then, we'll kind of just monitor and see how they're going, see if there's like certain days that they might be higher.  I know it can be kind of a pain to keep track of what you are eating, but if you do have time to kind of jot down a little bit of what you had for breakfast, lunch and dinner, that would be helpful too.  We will take a look at that in three months and hopefully you'll have more energy too."
"22","  Okay.  That's okay.  Do you think managing to just write down your blood sugars is manageable?"
"23","  Okay, okay, then that sounds good.  I think that will be enough just to have those blood sugars down and then with the dietitian part, even if your wife is interested in learning more she can go to those appointments too, to learn if she does most of the cooking, that could be helpful too if she is interested in that."
"24","  And any other questions or concerns?"
"25","  Yes, I'm really glad that you came in and at least from your labs that I can see your A1c is the only thing that's not exactly where we want it, but it's 4.9 is still, I mean not 4.9 sorry, 7.9 is still better than some that I've seen a lot of people will be up in the 12, so…"
"26","  Yeah, you're doing pretty well and I don't think that you should have anything to worry about with passing away anytime soon."
"27","  Yes.  Anything else?"
"28","  Yeah, yeah, and I hope this increase in glipizide will help with that and if it doesn’t in the next three months we'll kind of explore more and try to figure out, how to get that energy back, so that you can play with your grandkids again."
"29","  Perfect.  Well, see you in three months."
"30","  You too, thanks.  Have a good night."
