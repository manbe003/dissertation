"1","  Hello, Mr. Johnson.  Oh, I can't hear you.  I think you are muted.  Oh, there you go."
"2","  Yeah, that's how to…"
"3","  Yeah."
"4","  I know.  It's a lot to handle sometimes.  My name is Sheila.  I'm a fourth-year medical student.  Is it all right if I chat with you today about what's been going on?"
"5","  Yeah.  So, what brings you in today?"
"6","  Yeah, sure, we can do that.  I'd love to hear a little bit more about this cold that you said that you've been having, when did that start and what kind of symptoms do you have and when did they start?"
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Yeah, I'm sorry you've been experiencing all that, that's kind of frustrating.  So, it sounds like you have had these symptoms for a few days.  Do you feel like they are about the same, getting better or worse?"
"9","  About the same, okay.  And you mentioned that you've had kind of a stuffy nose, did you mention a cough at all?"
"10","  Yeah, cough, okay.  You said that you were feeling warm, have you taken your temperature?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Okay, that's all right we can do it, we can do that in the office.  And have you had any other symptoms like headache or abdominal pain, or kind of vomiting, nausea?"
"13","  No, okay.  Has this kind of thing happened to your before in terms of?"
"14","  Did you get COVID?"
"15","  Yeah, that's ______ questions definitely been wearing on people.  Do you feel like you are concerned that you have COVID?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Okay.  And do you feel like, or have you had any contact with anybody who you know has had COVID or has had similar symptoms?"
"18","  Okay.  And have you taken anything for the symptoms?"
"19","  Has helped, okay.  Okay, and then have you had any other symptoms outside of those?"
"20","  Okay, increased like muscle aches, or chills?  Okay.  Do you usually get similar symptoms around this time of the year in terms of allergies like you're allergic to grass or anything?"
"21","  No, okay.  Is there anything else you were hoping to chat about today?"
"22","  Yeah, and I'm going to try and you mentioned that you haven’t been in to see the doctor in about 10 years or so?"
"23","  Do you have any like, medical conditions that you're aware of?"
"24","  Yeah, so we're just, you know, trying to make sure that there is not something else there that's going on that we just don't have on our chart.  So sometimes you've got like high blood pressure or things like that.  So that's good, and okay, and so it sounds right now that the best thing to do would probably be to get a COVID test.  How do you feel about that?"
"25","  Yes, so it depends on where you live and what's your current…"
"26","  Beacon Hill?  Okay.  I'm not super familiar with Seattle, but I think there should be a COVID like drive-through testing available and what's your kind of transportation situation like?"
"27","  Yeah, so basically, you would kind of go through drive-through testing, so you stay in your car, and then you kind of go in this line and then they'll take a swab and then run a test and then give you the results in the next like couple of days."
"28","  Yeah, so that's something I am potentially concerned about.  The other thing is, I wonder if this could also be allergy, allergies, I know this has been something that you necessarily have experienced before, but it is kind of the season and, you know your symptoms could be that even though you know you have also seemed to have like higher temperatures and that's what's making me a little bit more concerned about, like making sure that we're ruling out something like COVID, but those are kind of the things that I've been thinking about.  But I think the best thing is, you know continue taking the DayQuil or NyQuil as needed.  We can get a COVID-19 test and make sure that you're kind of like isolating until you get your test results.  Yeah, any, do you have any other questions or concerns?"
"29","  Yeah.  So I think because that was kind of the primary reason you came in, that I wanted to make sure that that was all set.  If you have time to talk about maybe kind of your general health, because I know you haven’t seen a doctor in 10 years, that's something we could do today is that something you you're interested in?"
"30","  Yeah.  So, you mentioned that you don't have any kind of medical history that you're aware of.  Have you ever been told that you have like high blood pressure or diabetes?"
"31","  No, okay.  How about like any kind of history of those things in your family?"
"32","  Okay.  Any histories of cancers?"
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Okay.  Yeah, do you know how old he was when he had colon cancer?"
"35","  Yeah.  Have you ever gotten a colonoscopy yourself?"
"36","  No, I just meant, have you ever had one done?"
"37","  You are 58, so, yeah I think that's something that would be a good idea to do.  I don't know how you feel about that, just in terms of like making sure everything is good."
"38","  No, there is no reason you have to.  I guess maybe you can tell me a little bit more about have you had any changes in bowel movements lately, like diarrhea, constipation, any blood in your stool? "
"39","  Okay, okay.  Yeah, so a colonoscopy is usually something that we recommend for people of certain age to kind of make sure that we're checking for potential like colon cancer, so you know, the earlier people catch it, the better and so usually recommend it like once every 10 years I think after the age of 50 and then, yeah, just to make sure that that's not an issue for you.  So, it's more of a preventative kind of thing."
"40","  Okay.  And have you had any chest pain recently, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath?"
"41","  No, okay.  And any like other kind of concerns physically?"
"42","  Okay.  How has your mood been recently?  I know thinks have been going on in the world."
"43","  Okay.  And then do you have a history of like drug use or smoking?"
"44","  Okay, okay.  And then it sounds like you have a girlfriend you mentioned.  Are you sexually active?"
"45","  And how many partners do you have?"
"46","  All righty.  Okay.  So it sounds like the colonoscopy is something that we could potentially do in terms of prevention, a kind of regular checkup type things, clearly I can't do a physical exam.  But it sounds like you don't have any other really primary concerns right now.  It sounds like you also want to get a sense of like if you, like how much you like drink on a regular basis, and how is your diet, how is exercise, like all those kind of things. "
"47","  Okay."
"48","  Awesome."
"49","  Okay, good, good.  And then do you drink at all?"
"50","  Okay, how much beer would you say you drink like every day?"
"51","  Okay.  Like 5, 10?"
"52","  Okay, okay.  And are you concerned at all about your, like the amount that you drink?"
"53","  Okay.  And all right, so if there are kind of any other concerns, I think the best thing to do would be, get the COVID test and kind of see how you're doing over the next few days, if things get worse you can certainly call us again, and then you know, continue the kind of as needed medications DayQuil or NyQuil, you can take some like any other kind of over-the-counter things that you feel like, like Tylenol.  And then, yeah, I guess what questions do you have?"
"54","  Oh, for a COVID vaccine?"
"55","  Oh, okay.  So that I think would be a little bit different.  So, there are a few options.  I think right now people are going online to sign up for the vaccine.  I'm not sure if we provide them there at the clinic, but…"
"56","  Yeah, oh go ahead."
"57","  Yeah, yes, those are different appointments.  So in terms of the colonoscopy, I can put in a referral for you and I'll just do that on my end and then someone will call you to schedule that, and then you can kindly go from there.  And then in terms of the COVID vaccine and so those, that's kind of separate from the COVID test that I want you to do.  So the COVID test is like they will swab up your nose and then they run some tests and then will tell you in a couple of days you know whether it's positive or negative.  And then the COVID vaccine, so I'm actually not entirely sure where online you can check but I can figure that out and then get back to you and give you a set of instructions maybe in the printout. "
"58","  I think that was it unless you had something else."
"59","  Okay.  All right, thank you, Mr. Johnson."
"60","  I think, let's see, I think we can end it now, request camera control.  I think so, you click the little leave button.  So, you see that button at the bottom of the screen?"
