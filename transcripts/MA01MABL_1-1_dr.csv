"1","  Good morning, Tom."
"2","  How are you?  I am Kate.  I am one of the student doctors working with the clinic today."
"3","  Oh no, I say. I looked over your chart a little bit.  It sounds like maybe you are having some fatigue, a little bit of shortness of breath, not feeling the best."
"4","  Okay."
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Hahaha.  Hey.  I think we all are."
"7","  Understandable.  It means she loves you."
"8","  Yeah.  I appreciate the allergic to doctors thing.  I swear we all say the same thing and here we are so.  But how long has this cold been going on?"
"9","  Okay and have you traveled lately?"
"10","  No.  Was that no or yes, sorry."
"11","  Okay, no worries."
"12","  No worries.  Have you noticed any with that cough? Have you brought anything up? Any green or yellow sputum?"
"13","  Okay.  Is it worse in the morning."
"14","   Okay.  Hey, that is all right.  Now you will be thinking about it the next couple of days."
"15","   And other than doctors, are you allergic to anything else?"
"16","  Okay.  I feel like at this point in your life, you would have found out by now, right?"
"17","  Yeah. Hahaha.  And no loss of smell or taste, which is good."
"18","  Okay.  "
"19","  Yeah, and this low-grade fever that they mentioned, do you have a thermometer at home?"
"20","   Okay."
"21","  Okay.  Have you felt kind of the opposite of that also where you feel really cold or chilly?"
"22","  Okay.  Well, that is a good sign.  And you said more tired lately.  "
"23","  Okay.  Has that been over the last week or has it been a lot longer than that?"
"24","  Okay, and feeling more sore in your muscles at all?"
"25","  Okay. Okay.  How is everything else in your life going?  You had any big changes, started a new job?  Had any changes?"
"26","  Okay."
"27","   Good."
"28","  You look pretty good in color wise, which is, it is kind of hard doing these telehealth visits as you know, we do not really get to put our hands on you, but our eyes can tell us a lot also.  I know you said you have not had any shortness of breath.  Have you felt any like palpitations or weird sensations in your chest?"
"29","  No, okay.  Any swelling in your legs or your hands that is new?"
"30","  Okay.  How about stomach?  Have you had any diarrhea or constipation?"
"31","   Okay."
"32","   Okay."
"33","   Okay."
"34","  Yeah, any constipation at all with it?"
"35","  No.  How about urination?  Are you able to kind of go and stop when you need to, have any frequency or feeling like you cannot empty your bladder?"
"36","  Okay, and do you wake up in the middle of the night to pee?"
"37","  Okay.  And have you had any long like road trips or been on a plane lately?"
"38","  Okay.  Good.  And your girlfriend?  Is she pretty good health?"
"39","  Okay.  So she has not brought anything home to you off the job site?"
"40","  Ah, okay. "
"41","  yeah, exactly.  It is always hard to know."
"42","  Well, beyond COVID, there is a lot of bugs kind of running around right now, especially in the schools, so. I do not want to take her side, but I will say it is probably a good thing you getting checked out."
"43","   Yeah.  (Laughing)  Have you noticed if you feel kind of on your neck, do you feel any new lumps or bumps?"
"44","  They are normal, perfect and any jaw pain or sinus pain at all?"
"45","  Okay.  And hearing just as well as usual?"
"46","  (Laughing) I will take that as a yes. Okay. Okay.  Well.  Other than it looks like your chart is pretty boring, you are taking that DayQuil.  Have you been taking that for a while or just recently?"
"47","  Okay.  Did it seem to help at all?"
"48","  And have you had a sore throat with it, with the cough."
"49","  Okay, Okay.  It does sound pretty much like it is just a cold without a high fever and kind of having those chills afterwards,  I have less suspicion for like the flu, which is one of those bugs that is kind of going around right now.  It does not seem like you have any COVID symptoms really. We are finding that kind of that can present; however, we can imagine it.  I would say gargling with salt water to kind of help with that postnasal drip that sometimes causes that cough especially when you have been sick, you are kind of having just that residual it gets down into your lungs and makes you kind of have to cough.  The DayQuil is really good.  You can also use just anything with guaifenesin in it or there is one with D dextromethorphan, which helps with your cough suppression and then as old fashioned as it is, some good old hot water, hot tea and honey helps to coat the throat also, kind of help some with that cough.  Have you had any snot at all?"
"50","  Okay.  Just pretty much lower."
"51","  Okay.  Does it hurt when you cough?"
"52","  Yeah."
"53","  Yeah.  Are you having to sleep sitting up a little bit?"
"54","  Okay."
"55","  Okay, have you tried cough drops at all?"
"56","  Okay, okay, do you mind if I ask what you have been using for your third stuff?"
"57","  Okay, good."
"58","   Okay, okay.  Yeah, I would say as long as you are not having any like fevers where you are feeling so, so hot and then you get those chills right afterwards, as long as youa re still able to eat and are you feeling kind of less tired as the days go on."
"59","  Okay.  Still pretty down and just tired."
"60","  Yeah.  And I think that is kind of the big thing we are finding with these colds, whether it is cold, a little bit of a flu or something else kind of going around is sleep, staying hydrated and with staying hydrated sometimes maybe throwing like a Pedialyte or Gatorade in there to keep your electrolytes up can help just kind of with a little bit more energy.  I have found most people like the Pedialyte a little bit better than the Gatorade.  Gatorade can kind of upset your stomach a little bit or make your throat weird, so."
"61","  Okay, perfect."
"62","  And you drink it down. "
"63","  Okay."
"64","  Yes, it has a lot more salt than everything, so.  Other than that, I would say.  You sound like you are doing pretty well.  If that cough gets worse, or if it is still there in a couple, like in a week and a half or two weeks, make sure you let us know because then we kind of start thinking, okay, are we missing a pneumonia or something else, but without a fever and without kind of the tinged sputum, I am not as worried about it."
"65","  So do you have any other questions for us or me?"
"66","  No other than a high fever or if you are feeling just down and more tired like within a week if you are not feeling better then also let us know."
"67","  And then the big things are just washing your hands and trying not to cough on anybody else."
"68","  Well, if I cannot do anything else for you today, I will let you go. Enjoy this beautiful day. I see the sunshine out your window."
"69","  Yeah, right.  It is nice meeting you."
"70","  Yup."
