"1","  Hey! Can you hear me?  I can’t hear you.  It says you’re still muted."
"2","  Awesome.  I can hear you now."
"3","  Doing well.  My name is Dr. Mozaffari.  Mr. Johnson, is that right?"
"4","  Okay.  So, I have some notes as to why you are seeing me today, but if you wouldn’t mind just telling me yourself, what made you make this appointment?"
"5","  Okay.  Do you know if you have had any contact with anyone who has COVID?"
"6","  Not that you know off, okay.  And your cough, has it lasted the full, you know, seven days?"
"7","  Is it dry or are you coughing stuff up?"
"8","  Coughing stuff up.  And what other symptoms are you experiencing?"
"9","  Fever?  Is that all?  "
"10","  Okay.  Have you felt you’ve swollen lymph nodes or anything like that?"
"11","  No.  Runny nose or sneezing?"
"12","  No.  How long has your fever lasted?"
"13","  Oh, wow.  You had it for a long time.  And taste and smell, is that still there?"
"14","  Still able to taste and smell.  Are you vaccinated?"
"15","  No.  And have you had COVID before?"
"16","  No.  Okay.  Well, it sounds like, you know, this could be a myriad of things, common cold, could be COVID.  Definitely good to get tested, just to make sure that that is not it.  CDC Guidelines are changing a lot as to what people should do with COVID if they have it.  Do you live alone?  You live with people or?  "
"17","  You live with you girlfriend.  Is she feeling sick as well?"
"18","  No, okay, and have you been going, do you work or have you been going to work in these past days, even feeling sick?"
"19","  Yeah, okay.  Okay, we will then, let us just, what I can do is put in an appointment for you to get tested.  We can get you swabbed just to make sure that it’s not COVID.  If it’s, then I think the CDC recommendation right now is to quarantine for five days just to make sure it is not transmitting to people that you are seeing.  Otherwise, are you having a sore throat?"
"20","  No.  Okay.  I asked just because you know strep throat is also something that is the possibility but typically that presents with really, really sore throat.  So, if that is not the case, we can go ahead and look to getting you COVID tested before we move forward with anything else.  Is there anything else that you are wanting to chat with me about before, besides potential COVID testing?"
"21","  No.  Okay.  Then I am going to put in an appointment for you to get nasal swabbed.  Do you think that that is something that you could do tomorrow or this week?"
"22","  Okay.  Yeah.  We can, I can send you a link and you can choose the time and day that works best for you as long as you feel like you are able to make it to the nearest pharmacy or whatever location is closest to you to come on and get that nasal swab.  Does that sound good?"
"23","  Okay.  Great.  I will submit that and then, if there is nothing else that you want to talk about today, then that can be it."
"24","  Thank you.  Have a great one."
"25","  Bye."
