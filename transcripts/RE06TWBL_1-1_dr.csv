"1","  Hi."
"2","  Are you Freddie?"
"3","  Perfect."
"4","  Good, how are you?"
"5","  Alright, I am Morgan.  I am a third-year medical student talking with you today.  "
"6","  Is that alright?"
"7","  Nice to meet you too.  Looking ahead on your chart, it sounds like we’re going to talk a little bit about diabetes and a little bit of some leg pain you’re having?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay, is there one of those, the fatigue or the diabetes, you would like to talk about first?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Have you been getting your blood sugars measured at home?"
"12","  Perfect, are you taking it in the mornings before you eat or just kind of throughout the day?"
"13","  Okay, what readings are you usually getting?"
"14","  Okay, do you get any below 200?"
"15","  Yeah, that’s alright.  So, usually kind of in the 200s it sounds like."
"16","  Alright, and you’re on two medications for your diabetes?"
"17","  Right and any difficulties taking those?"
"18","  Okay, and any side effects that you’ve noticed?"
"19","  Good, alright, seems like you’ve been on both for quite some time."
"20","  Alright, okay and do you remember I cannot see it in your chart, the last time you came into the doctors to get blood work, do you remember what your last A1c was?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  Alright, so it’s been sometime, right.  With diabetes sometimes people can get numbness and tingling in their hands and feet, how you noticed any of that?"
"23","  Okay, has it gotten any worse since the last time you’ve been in to the doctor?"
"24","  Okay and with this when was the last time you’ve gotten your eyes checked?"
"25","  Okay, any changes in your vision that you’ve noticed?"
"26","  Alright, okay, no changes in vision, no numbness and tingling in your feet.  Have you noticed you’re going to the bathroom more than usual recently or anything like that?"
"27","  Yeah, hard to avoid sometimes.  In the last year, have you ever got in readings that are above 300?"
"28","  Of your blood sugar."
"29","  Okay and no below 100 where you feel like your blood sugar is too low."
"30","  Okay, good, alright.  Do you have any concerns in particular with your diabetes today?"
"31","  Right, that’s really tough.  Tell me more about that fatigue, what’s it like for you?"
"32","  Okay, how long has that’s been lasting?"
"33","  Like has this been going on for the last couple of months or about a year?"
"34","  Okay, so you’ve noticed it’s been worsening?"
"35","  Yeah, okay.  With this, do you feel like it’s caused by anything in particular, I know you mentioned that you’re worried it was related to your diabetes?"
"36","  Yeah, it started slowly and surely you can’t think of one day where you’re like damn I am exhausted."
"37","  Okay, how was your sleep then?"
"38","  Okay, fall asleep, okay?"
"39","  Okay and do you go to the bathroom three or four times at night or how often are you getting up?"
"40","  Okay, when you go to the bathroom do you feel like you’re emptying your bladder all the way?"
"41","  Okay, and with that, do you have any hesitancy in your urine stream or difficulty starting urinating?"
"42","  Okay and when you go to bed at night, do you or someone else in your household noticed that you snore at all?"
"43","  Okay, but nothing that you felt like you better stopped breathing at night because you’re snoring so much?"
"44","  Okay, good.  Do you feel like this fatigue is from lack of sleep or does it feel a little different from that?"
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Okay.  How has your mood been?"
"47","  Hmm.  Do you feel like you’re still enjoying the things you normally do like hanging out with your grandkids?"
"48","  Right.  Any changes in your appetite at all?"
"49","  Okay and any weight loss that you’ve noticed?"
"50","  Alright. With this fatigue, do you have any body aches or pains?"
"51","  Okay and any headaches at all?"
"52","  Okay, sounds like it’s been frustrating for you."
"53","  Hmmm.  When you do things like play with your grandkids, do you feel like you get any chest pain or any shortness of breath?"
"54","  No, it’s just really that fatigue, feeling worn out."
"55","  Okay.  Well Freddie, I think there is two things we’re really focusing on today, the diabetes, your blood sugar readings are a little higher than I would like to see in the mornings as well as this fatigue waking up tired and not being able to go about your routine like you would like to is not something we want.  I am worried about two things with that, I think it’s possible that you’re getting poor sleep and fatigue because you’re up going to the bathroom so many times a night.  When we sleep, we go into deep sleep which helps us a feel little rested and if you’re waking up every few hours to go to the bathroom, you’re not getting into that well rested phase.  Does that make sense?"
"56","  I think for you where I want to start is getting some blood work to see whether this is caused by your diabetes, where you’re going to the bathroom all the time just because you’re having some high blood sugars which can make you pee more or if you have something called BPH, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and that’s something that happens with the prostate as men age and it’s super common, not uncommon for men to start feeling like they’re needing to go to the bathroom all the time and when they go to the bathroom like they’re not finishing all the way."
"57","  Do you have any questions about that?"
"58","  Okay, well I think what’s next is I am going to order some labs to take a look at your prostate as well as your blood sugar, it’s been a while since you’ve been in like you’ve said.  So, I would also like to take a look at your cholesterol and your blood counts."
"59","  If that’s okay with you and then from there we’ll see if we need to increase your medications for your diabetes."
"60","  And then if this is something like BPH, we have medications that will help so that you’re not going to the bathroom as frequently, which I am hoping would help with your sleep and your fatigue as well."
"61","  Yeah and with that looking at your blood counts and your cholesterol along with this, we’ll see if there is anything else abnormal that might point us towards the different reason for your fatigue?"
"62","  Alright."
"63","  Sounds reasonable on your end?"
"64","  Alright.  Are there any other worries that I haven’t addressed yet?"
"65","  Alright, I’ll get those labs put in and have you go get your blood drawn at sometime in the near future, okay."
"66","  Alright, I think that’s all I have for you."
"67","  Yeah, thank you so much.  Bye, bye."
