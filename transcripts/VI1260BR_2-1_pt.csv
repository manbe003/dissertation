"1","  Yes, hello."
"2","  Well, I have been better."
"3","  Well, basically, I think I have a cold and my girlfriend thinks I have COVID, and so, she wants me to get checked out, and so it's probably just a waste of time, but anyway, what can I tell you?"
"4","  Just basically, my head stuffed up, a little bit of a cough, and I feel a little feverish sometimes, I guess.  But, but I think it's just exaggerated.  I don't think I have COVID."
"5","  I know if I had that I mean, it's..."
"6","  Since last weekend."
"7","  For about four or five days, maybe."
"8","  Not that I know of.  I work in construction, and I am around other guys, but we are basically working, so we don't spend that much time together."
"9","  Not that I know of, no."
"10","  Not really."
"11","  No, no, nothing."
"12","  I get diarrhea once in a while, about once a week or so, but..."
"13","  That has been going on for a number of years."
"14","  No."
"15","  I just kind of feel hot.  I don't know, I had a thermometer, but I can't find what I did with it, it's..."
"16","  Yeah."
"17","  I wish, no."
"18","  No."
"19","  Oh, do I need to go line up and get tested for COVID, someplace or..."
"20","  Okay."
"21","  I guess I just want to make my girlfriend happy."
"22","  She wants me to get a test, so I am gonna test."
"23","  No, she seems okay, I mean."
"24","  Oh, yes, ________ even before the pandemic."
"25","  Where do I need to go to do that?"
"26","  ________ too or whatever."
"27","  Beacon Hill."
"28","  Okay."
"29","  I have been using the DayQuil-NyQuil thing.  That is better"
"30","  Just a couple of times a day, the NyQuil and then try the DayQuil when I get up."
"31","  Oh, I don't know, I guess so, maybe."
"32","  I see."
"33","  Okay."
"34","  All I have been doing lately is just fall asleep."
"35","  No, I have had cold before, but have not been sick much lately."
"36","  Yeah."
"37","  Okay."
"38","  Yeah."
"39","  Yeah.  Maybe I got a cold, maybe I got COVID, nobody will know until I get a test.  If I am getting a test, then Emily needs to get a test too and so we will, I was gonna jot that down, contact the UW about a van in our area and Beacon Hill or I don’t like, I am not sure what number to call."
"40","  Um, well, yeah, sometimes."
"41","  Okay, that sounds like that should be easy to do."
"42","  Good, yeah."
"43","  Is there anything else we need to talk about then or?"
"44"," No, I don’t know, that is it, I guess."
"45","  No, I guess I understand, yeah."
"46","  Thanks."
"47","  Bye."
