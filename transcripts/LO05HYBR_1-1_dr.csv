"1","  Hi Tom."
"2","  I’m doing well.  My name is Nancy.  I’m the healthcare worker who is going to see you today, and what brings you to this visit today?"
"3","  Oh, okay.  What is she concerned about?"
"4","  Okay."
"5","  Right, is it a work issue?"
"6","  Oh, got it, got it, got it.  Okay, okay.  So I hear a couple of things.  I hear that there is, you want to make sure you’re healthy and then I also hear there is some concern for potential COVID, are you having any symptoms right now?"
"7","  Oh, okay."
"8","  Yeah, okay."
"9","  Yeah, so just a, do you have questions about COVID-19 or…? "
"10","  Yes."
"11","  Yeah.  How long have you been coughing for?"
"12","  Okay.  Have you been COVID tested at all during that time?"
"13","  Have you been COVID tested at all during that time period?"
"14","  No, okay.  Couple more questions just about your cough; is there, are you coughing anything up like…?"
"15","  Yeah.  And then is it worse in the morning or maybe at night?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Yeah, you notice it in the middle of the day and that makes sense to me.  I just, you know, I know I’m asking a lot of questions, I just want to make sure we are not missing anything and…"
"18","  Any recent weight loss?"
"19","  Do you ever wake up feeling like in the middle of the night, like really covered in sweat or anything like that?"
"20","  Yeah, okay.  So it sounds like you’ve had a cough that your wife has noticed that you are kind of noticing in the middle of the day and no recent weight loss, no like, I guess it does not wake you up in the middle of the night ever?"
"21","  Okay.  Is it getting worse or is it kind of about the same?"
"22","  Okay, okay.  And then, Tom, any smoking history at all?"
"23","  Yeah, okay.  Just going to ask a couple more questions any history of allergies, asthma?"
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Yeah.  And any asthma?"
"26","  Okay, okay.  And do you have, I always ask my patients questions you know just like, I’m here, I’m going to give you my opinion, but also you live with yourself every day, do you have any ideas about this maybe, just, any other concerns or anything?"
"27","  Well, are you currently, I think we should definitely do a COVID test.  I think it is a good idea.  My question for you is, are you currently vaccinated for COVID-19?"
"28","  No."
"29","  Yeah, I think, so just to be really transparent Tom, when someone tells me that you have had a cough for a couple of weeks, there are a couple of things, I have been, I’m thinking about, I think about things like asthma, I think about things like allergies.  I honestly think about things like possibility for very rarely, but possible like cancer in the chest, and then I also do think about COVID.  And I think what sounds like most likely I’m not worried about cancer from what you just told me.  I am not worried about allergies or asthma right now, but I do think it is worthwhile to get a COVID test just to see."
"30","  Yeah.  And then I think, that’s it, I’ve talked to ______ I think it will be great if you come back into the office and we can talk about the COVID vaccines more, I know, a lot of my patients..."
"31","  Yeah.  And I think, it is what you want to hear me say that like, it’s been a rough couple of years and there has been a lot of information and misinformation out there and I’m here to make sure you feel like, you have the information and you are making a decision that is right for you."
"32","  And then as I’m rambling this off like, I realize I forget to ask you, are you feeling short of breath walking up stairs at all?"
"33","  Great.  And then Tom, I think if you are going to come in, obviously you want to get a COVID test before hand.  Are there any other concerns you have that you want to address may be at a future visit, because we are slated for 15 minutes right now, I think you have not seen a doctor in a while and may be it would be good to come in for like a longer visit, so you want to maybe think about things we could talk about."
"34","  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, just to give you a heads up on stuff that when you, I think we are going to do the COVID test when we have you come back, things I like to talk about with my patients on what we call like health maintenance and things like that, I will recommend a cancer screening type stuff that we do at those visits or order things we could talk about."
"35","  And then sometimes we talk about bloodwork and that is just…"
"36","  Because actually I am your doctor ______."
"37","  Yeah, because you know I am going to talk about, also bring your wife that you know, getting her happy is a good way. "
"38","  Something like that, everything healthy is always a good way to stay happy."
"39","  Hey Tom, thank you for your time.  I am going to go ahead and put that order in for a COVID test and you will be contacted about how to schedule that.  And then also we will set up an appointment, a longer in-person appointment just to get caught up on everything else."
"40","  Okay, all right.  I am going to let you, and just for the interview, thank you for your time."
"41","  Oh, anything else?  Anything else?"
"42","  Yes.  Oh I am glad you are here too.  It has been great talking to you and can I look forward to meeting you in-person, just taking care of you?"
"43","  Okay."
"44","  Yeah, yeah, oh hit the button."
