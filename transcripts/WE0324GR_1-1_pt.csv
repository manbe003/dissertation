"1","  Is that better?"
"2","  I am doing good today and you?"
"3","  Okay."
"4","  Just exhausted.  You know, just tired.  I feel I guess more tired in the last six to eight months than I have in the past and so I know my diabetes may have something to do with it, but I haven’t been in for about a year or so.  I just wanted to kind of check with you to see if everything is okay."
"5","  I would say probably it’s more lack of energy than anything else.  I have you know throughout the course of the day, I just need to, you know, take more breaks than I have in the past.  I just noticed that you know I just take more breaks than when I get home, I have three grand kids that my wife watches during the course of the day and so when I get in around 5"
"6","  Yes, a little.  I have noticed more frequent urination."
"7","  No.  That’s about it."
"8","  No.  Not really.  No."
"9","  No."
"10","  No."
"11","  I average between 6 and 7 hours a night.  I may get up maybe twice some nights to go urinate and some nights it’s three times and three times that I mean I am just really tired when I wake up because my sleep has been interrupted, but on average I try to get in between you know 6 to 7 may be 8 hours of sleep."
"12","  Yes.  Relative to some nights I only get up once and then when I wake up in the morning I feel more energized because of that constant sleep and I said this urination during the course of the night just interrupts my sleep and so I am a little, I would say a little sluggish not tired but just not fully energized more or less."
"13","  Yes."
"14","  I probably do, but it probably doesn’t you know irritate her enough for her to make any, you know, comments about it."
"15","  Yes. "
"16","  I would say probably about six or eight months ago."
"17","  You know.  I don’t really have real definitive timeframe, but I would think probably six or eight months ago, I started noticing that I was urinating a little more frequently.  You know."
"18","  No.  My urination is somewhat it was like when I was 6 years old.  Okay.  You know.  It depends on I would say the one of the factors that I take into consideration is that I try not to drink any liquids after like 8 o’clock.  You know or maybe water or something like that, but other than that that’s just about it."
"19","  No.  No pain no blood in the urine."
"20","  And to answer your question in terms of stream as I get older it’s not as stronger as it was when I was 21 years old so I think that’s just a part of the aging process.  I am hoping you are thinking."
"21","  Yes."
"22","  Yes.  I have had the examination.  I think I started receiving when I was about 50 and so on my annual visits you know I get the digital examination plus the PSA.  The result said it is getting a little bit larger, but just only recently have I noticed that it just causes me I am assuming that it causes of me to just have more urination the frequency of it so again I am trying to do things to minimize the impact so by not drinking a lot of liquid after 8 o’clock."
"23","  Okay."
"24","  Yes.  I occasionally about every two weeks I am taking my medications, but I tried to take it frequently, you know each day but a couple of times, during a course I do miss."
"25","  Yes.  I do."
"26"," Well, this morning it was like 215 and I just noticed that it’s slowly gradually creeping into the yellow zone, but I do, first thing in the morning I do check my glucose."
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Okay.  Alright."
"29","  It has been great.   I don’t consider.  I don’t notice any depression or anything like that.  I am just going along just getting a little older, but that’s the only thing that is on my head most of the time."
"30","  Yes.  Yes."
"31","  Well not really.  I am just, I guess the course that’s on my head and seems to be constant is that I know I am getting older, but am I about to die you know so because of all these changes that’s going on with my body and so any thoughts along those lines?"
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Okay.  Alright and that seems to be you know my main concern is that that I wasn’t close to dying and if I did I even I need to make some changes, but I would like to manage my diabetes with medication if it all possible so again I know the numbers are kind of gradually creeping up so whatever you would recommend I think it would be acceptable to me."
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Okay.  Okay."
"36","  Okay, alright.  That sounds like a plan. Okay."
"37","  Alright.  Thank you so much."
"38","  Bye, bye."
