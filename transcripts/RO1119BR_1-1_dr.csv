"1","  Hello Mr. Jones."
"2","  I’m well, thank you.  My name is Anne Hagerty.  I'm a third year medical student going to be interviewing you today.  I was just wondering what you'd prefer to be called."
"3","  Freddie, okay.  Well, it's nice to meet you Freddie.  How are you today?"
"4","  Oh, that's a lot to keep up with."
"5","  Maybe at the end of the appointment you can show me their pictures."
"6","  Yes.  Well, thank you for sharing some of the background information, that's helpful.  And I'm really glad that you're here today.  If you don't mind, I'd love to just hear a little bit more about, you know, the running out of steam and what that's looked like for you?"
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Freddie, do you mind me asking how you're sleeping at night?"
"9","  I'm just curious, has your wife ever mentioned that you snore really loudly or seem to be waking up in the middle of the night?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Yeah.  Okay, well, I guess Freddie, I have several questions that I could and would like to ask you, but I'm curious if you have any ideas for what might be going on?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Okay.  Yeah, okay.  So it sounds like what I'm hearing from you is, you've been feeling more tired recently and you think it might be related to your diabetes, and so is your goal for this appointment to work more on the diabetes?"
"14","  A new provider?"
"15","  Yeah."
"16","  Okay.  That sounds good.  Thank you for sharing.  Do you mind my asking why you, what prompted you to switch providers in the first place?"
"17","  Okay.  Yeah, I think that's understandable.  So as we move forward and I'm really happy to be working with you, I think the most important thing is that we set goals that, you know, you feel good about and feel like sustainable, and so I agree with you, I don't think we need to make a bunch of big changes at once.  I think it sounds like the fried chicken Sunday afternoon with your family is very important to you and so that's something we can revisit in the future if you want, but I think right now, it sounds like that's something that needs to stay in your life.  So maybe we can think about some other possible changes that you could make.  How does that sound?"
"18","  Yeah.  What is your kind of I guess typical day look like when you think about your diabetes care?  You mentioned checking your blood sugar a couple of times a week, what else are you doing?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Okay, great.  Going back to the medications really quick, are you satisfied with those?"
"21","  Okay.  Well, there actually are several other medication options that aren't insulin.  I noticed in your chart that it says you have essential hypertension or high blood pressure and so there are a couple of medications that treat diabetes and can also help lower your blood pressure.  So that's something that we could consider.  You know, as we discuss these medications, all of them have their pros and their cons, but I think that you know, we probably could maybe make some changes that might help maximize the therapeutic benefit you're getting from the medication, like if it was targeting two problems instead of just one, what do you think about that?"
"22","  Okay.  Yeah, I'm sorry and I should have asked you that.  I'm reading it in your chart underneath where it talks about you having high cholesterol, but it sounds like you've not heard about it before."
"23","  No, that's okay.  That might be something we could do today is just take your blood pressure in the office and then we can schedule a followup appointment for a couple weeks from now and check it again, and see if we're actually dealing with high blood pressure or not."
"24","  I am so sorry.  I thought we were in the office.  This is just a virtual thing.  Okay.  No, that's okay.  Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?"
"25","  Okay.  You know, many pharmacies have blood pressure like stations that you can go get your blood pressure checked.  Is that something you think you might be able to manage?"
"26","  Yeah, I understand."
"27","  Yeah, yeah.  I am sorry, it sounded like you didn’t want to come to the office, but whatever makes you feel the most comfortable.  And I would say that we could just wait, but blood pressure is pretty important keeping it under control and making sure that it's in a good range well, you know, improve your long-term health.  And so, I do think it should be a priority if you're okay with it."
"28","  Okay.  Yeah, and Freddie, I just want to make sure since this is our first appointment together, and we only have so much time, that you know, we address what you want to address and I would like to ask just a few more questions about the fatigue.  I'm reading and know in your chart that says that you sometimes have had trouble standing for more than a couple of hours.  Could you tell me more about that?"
"29","  For a while."
"30","  Oh, I'm really glad to hear that."
"31","  Okay.  So now it's more just feeling sleepy in the afternoon and then not having energy at the end of the day."
"32","  Okay.  Are you feeling rested when you first wake up?"
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Okay.  Yeah, so I guess I have a couple of things on my mind for what could be causing your fatigue.  But again, when you are going on your walks, are those going okay?"
"35","  Okay.  Well, I love that you're being creative.  Is it bothersome to you like you know you can't or you don't feel comfortable just walking outside?"
"36","  What do you mean by that?"
"37","  Hi Freddie, hi Bill.  It looks like she must have frozen.  Let's give her maybe a minute or two to see if she comes back."
"38","  That's okay."
"39","  No worries.  I'm going to give her a minute to rejoin on her own and then I'll give her a call and see if we can sort this out."
"40","  Let's -- I'm not sure if it would put her back in the waiting room.  So yeah, if it's okay with you, I could give you a call once her session is done."
"41","  Okay, great."
"42","  Can you hear me okay?"
"43","  Yes."
"44","  Thank you for your patience."
"45","  Okay.  Thank you for your patience.  You know, I just want to ask you a few questions that I try and ask all of my patients.  How would you say that your mood has been lately?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Okay.  That makes sense.  All right.  Well, you know, I think there are a lot of different things that can cause fatigue and sometimes our mood plays into it.  Sometimes there are low levels of iron in our blood that can make us tired.  Sometimes it's just that we need to exercise a little bit more and paradoxically that actually increases our energy levels or it could be that at night you're not actually getting a good night's rest and I think based off of what you've told me, that might be my best guess.  But I don't know.  I just want to give you one more chance to see if you think that anyone of those seems more likely to you."
"48","  Freddie, remind me, did you say you're exercising about two days a week?"
"49","  Okay, okay.  Well, I feel like we have talked about a lot of different things, but also ______ we don't think we should make lots of big changes.  You know, the recommendation are between around 30 minutes a day at least five days a week and you can exercise a little bit more or less on the minutes side depending on the intensity, but I wonder if -- do you think you have enough energy of exercise?"
"50","  Okay.  Yeah.  I just, I think it could be helpful to set one goal moving forward and if makes you feel better, that could be a good one.  But we don't have to make that a goal.  Is there anything as far as your diet that you think would be a good goal to make?  It could just be a small change."
"51","  Are you drinking any beverages during the day Freddie?  I find that for some patients that can be a helpful thing."
"52","  What kind of soda Freddie?"
"53","  Okay, yeah, I just was wondering if you were doing.  Okay.  You know, I've had a lot of patients in the past who have found that cutting out some of the colas can be helpful because they contain a lot of sugar in them.  And feel that…"
"54","  You know, sugar will give us energy, but some sugars are better for our body than others.  The sugar you eat pretty quickly and so sometimes they peak our energy really quick and then we crash, and so we prefer to eat carbohydrates that take a little bit longer to absorb and be metabolized, if that makes any sense."
"55","  Yeah.  Freddie, do you think, and again I want to find something that works for you, but you could try this week cutting down the size of your soda at lunch or dinner quantity?"
"56","  Okay.  What are you putting in your coffee?"
"57","  Okay, how much cream and sugar?"
"58","  Okay.  You know, I think it would be more helpful if you didn't replace that extra soda with coffee just because it sounds like the coffee you're drinking still might have a fair amount of sugar in it and based on adding a couple of teaspoons and the half-and-half, do you think that you could just maybe decrease the soda and leave it at that?"
"59","  Okay.  Okay.  Well Freddie, I've given a couple of ideas and it seems like you are not very excited about it, so is there anything that you think would be a good goal?"
"60","  I’m sorry.  Okay."
"61","  I did."
"62","  Okay.  Well Freddie, I think this has been really good for me to meet you and get to know you and kind of hear what your goals are.  This is kind of what's on my mind.  I'd like to do some lab draws.  So maybe your lipids or your cholesterol, a new A1c which is you know as you know the average of your blood sugar.  I'd like to measure your blood pressure and I think that would be helpful for helping us make the decisions moving forward.  I also think that if you could write down a couple of days this week what you're eating and drinking every day and then when you're taking your medications and then lastly your blood sugar, I think that would give us some information before we make any changes to your medications.  For you to get those labs done and you to bring me your diary…"
"63","  Okay.  Could you add your meals to it and when you're taking your medications?"
"64","  Okay.  And I think that’s what we should do moving forward and then maybe you can think about some possible changes you might want to make and we can talk about it more at your next appointment, but I think just kind of establishing a baseline would be helpful.  Does that sound okay?"
"65","  Okay.  Well Freddie, it was so nice to meet you.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing you in the office in a couple of weeks."
"66","  Thank you.  Freddie, one more thing, what questions do you have if any?"
"67","  Yeah.  And we can talk more about it next time.  I know that we need to cover a lot and there is a lot to cover with diabetes, so we'll take our time."
"68","  All right, take care."
