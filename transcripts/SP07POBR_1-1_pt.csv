"1","  Hello there.  Sorry, I have to push all the right buttons and stuff."
"2","  Oh, I've been better."
"3","  I think I've just got a cold, but my girlfriend wants me to come in and get tested for COVID just in case, but I think it's just a cold."
"4","  Oh, I'm just tired.  I got a stuffed up nose and little bit of a scratchy throat and cough, the cold."
"5","  Oh, about a week."
"6","  No, no it's about the same."
"7","  No, I had a thermometer, I think my ex has it now.  I just figured I'm a little warm, must be about 99 degrees or so."
"8","  Oh, I mean, I got this cold, it's basically, I don't know, it's that's what I mean it's as, I don't know, it seems like that's the only thing."
"9","  No, I don't think so."
"10","  Oh, I get it."
"11","  Oh, no."
"12","  I don't think so."
"13","  Constructions."
"14","  No.  Several different places they send us.  I mean, I'm not in charge.  I don't know what their schedule is.  They keep us busy though."
"15","  Oh, I work full-time, but at least for 40 hours."
"16","  Yeah, I just figured goo, mucus or whatever."
"17","  I don't know, it's just mucus."
"18","  Yeah, it's sort of clearish whitish, clear."
"19","  No, kind of in between."
"20","  Oh I see, I take NyQuil and DayQuil just you know cold meds."
"21","  No, it kind of helps me sleep a little bit."
"22","  Oh, no."
"23","  Well, about 10 years ago I guess, one of the reason my girlfriend wants me to see you is I've not been there for a while."
"24","  No."
"25","  I usually have a few beers with dinner."
"26","  Oh, I like the, you know, microbreweries a little bit of taste, I don't care for the light beers and stuff like that and Figueroa beer, you might love beer."
"27","  Oh, it’s pretty much normal, I guess."
"28","  Yes, basically what I mean, I mean I wanted to know is, do I have COVID or do I have a cold."
"29","  Oh, other than that, I mean, how are things looking I mean?"
"30","  Oh, yeah."
"31","  Yeah, she's vaccinated.  She is always on me to get vaccinated and I am like you know just wait and see.  ____ yeah so."
"32","  Well, no I guess not.  I mean I just haven’t found the time or whatever."
"33","  Can I just go get the shot now and get that over?"
"34","  Okay."
"35","  That's what I was doing."
"36","  Okay, I guess so."
"37","  Well, basically, I'm, I work full-time.  I don't really have time to take off during the week and I'm pretty healthy all the time.  I don't need to worry too much.  So, I don't know, it's just hard to take some time to schedule something that I don't always need, you know. "
"38","  No, I don't want that.  So except for the cold or whatever, things are looking okay then and so we'll just schedule something else?"
"39","  Yeah."
"40","  Oh, I don't do too much in the way of meds and things."
"41","  Water, you know, okay."
"42","  So basically drink a lot of water and get sleep and get a do-it-yourself test and I mean basically is and then make an appointment to come in and talk to you later, is that what you want?"
"43","  Yeah, okay."
"44","  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean it sounds like I can do everything myself.  Anyway I'm not sure why I'm here exactly, but my girlfriend wants me to do it and see if there's anything I need to look at and stuff and so, I guess so, whatever."
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Well, not that I can think of, no."
"47","  Okay."
"48","  Bye.  So what do I push on this thing here?"
"49","  Oh, I got you, okay."
