"1","  Hi, is it Mr. Jones?"
"2","  Potash, very close."
"3","  Mr. Jones.  It is nice to meet you."
"4","  Good, good.  And you can just call me Jordan.  It is a, it is a hard last name, but I am just, I am a new member of your care team.  So, it is great to meet you.  I am glad that you could come in and see me today."
"5","  Mr. Jones, what do you prefer to go by?"
"6","  It sounds good, all right.  Well, how can I help you today?"
"7","  Good, good.  Well, I am glad you are in, glad we can get things sorted today.  So, I was looking through your chart a little bit and I did see that you do have diabetes and that you have previously been on two medications.  Are you still on those?"
"8","  Yeah, yeah okay.  And are you still taking those every day?"
"9","  Okay, okay.  So, you say that you would really only miss a day, would you say once every, like two weeks?"
"10","  Okay, okay.  Now, that sounds very reasonable.  That sounds, that is life right?"
"11","  Exactly and how are you taking those two meds?  Is it one each per day? one of the glipizide, two of the metformin?"
"12","  Milligrams."
"13","  Okay and you are taking the glipizide once a day and the metformin?"
"14","  Okay, good.  Do you feel like that the easiest for you to remember?  It is just taken when you wake up in the morning?"
"15","  Good, good.  Okay."
"16","  Are you so for the other tests, are you talking about, are you doing finger sticks to check your glucose?"
"17","  Okay, and do you, how often do you check your blood sugars?"
"18","  Okay.  Um, do you usually check in the morning before you take your meds or..."
"19","  Okay, okay.  Are you having any issues with, with checking your blood sugar or not having enough of the supplies?"
"20","  Oh, yeah, no, definitely.  So, would you say that has been the main thing you felt the last couple of months or it is just feeling really kind of tired and rundown?"
"21","  Okay and did anything happen like you have gotten sick or gone to the hospital or anything when this all started or did you just feel like it gradually came on?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay and you said it probably started about the last six, about six months ago."
"24","  Well, I am, I am sorry you are feeling this way and not feeling up to your usual energy level, but I am glad, I am glad you came in and hopefully, we can sort things out, so we can get you feeling better.  That will be our goal for today, I think."
"25","  (Laughs) Gotta, you are chasing around those grandkids, right?"
"26","  (Laughs) I can appreciate that for sure.  Just so, I make sure that we are getting a clear picture, would you say that this feeling of being tired or fatigued, is it all day long thing, at the end of the day or when you wake up?"
"27","  Okay.  That is good.  It is nice to get a clearer picture, you know, kind of just when things go on.  I think I saw on your chart too that you had mentioned something about your feet or feeling a little more tired on your feet."
"28","  Yeah, okay."
"29","  Yeah, yeah, now I can imagine, but I really like that you are trying to get out to exercise more.  Hopefully, I am with you.  It is a lot harder when the weather is not great and hopefully as spring fully gets here and summer starts coming on, it will be better with the better weather for sure.  So, I really, I really applaud you for trying to get out more walking, walking is a great exercise.  So, to talk about your legs though, in that you are feeling tired, did they just feel, do they feel achy?  Is it burning?  Do they just feel like you can't take another step?"
"30","  That is ________(laughs).  No, that makes, that makes sense.  Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or your toes?"
"31","  Okay, any burning or pins and needles sensation?"
"32","  Okay, okay.  Well, I don't know if you've talked about this with your other diabetes providers before, but sometimes when your diabetes progresses, you can start to get issues with your nerves and it can be the nerves down in your feet and in your fingers because those are the kind of the farthest down from your heart that sometimes that when your diabetes gets a little more out of kind of that range, we talk about with your hemoglobin A1c where we don't have as tighter control, sometimes that can affect your peripheral nerves and that can cause some of that damage.  So, I wonder if that is something that could also be affecting your nerve, the way your legs are feeling that kind of the numbness you are getting off and on.  Maybe not necessarily this is like kind of chronic tiredness and fatigue.  I think that could be a factor, maybe not the whole thing, but I think it would be a really good idea today to check some labs and just see where your hemoglobin A1c is and see if maybe we need to get a little bit tighter control, just trying to help preserve some of those nerves you have in your feet."
"33","  Yeah, no, I think, I think 8 is a great goal.  I think a couple of years before I had seen prior, you even had it down in the 6s.  So, I think our goal would just be checking today seeing where you are at, and you know, I am a big believer in like one step at a time.  So, I am not saying, say today if it was that 8 or above 8 to immediately get you down to 5 within three months.  It is nothing like that we do nothing too hard on the body, so a little, little steps at a time.  I think your goal of being below 8 right now is good, but I think we could be maybe I think our goal, our next goal would be maybe down below 7, but let's first let's just check and see where you are at today."
"34","  I know we get your labs back before we kind of talk about any, you know, number goals.  I think, looking at numbers and having labs in front of you are nice, they are nice to look at.  It is nice to see the numbers, but I, I think it is good to base things on kind of how you are feeling."
"35","  Yeah and also, like I was saying, when your diabetes does kind of get when the sugars are a little higher, more consistently and that number does get higher, that can also just be hard on your body overall and that can also be a component of your this kind of just feeling fatigued and tired, but I don't want to attribute everything to one disease.  So, I think I might ask you a couple of more questions just to make sure that we are checking all the right labs and everything while I have you today, just so we can try and cover it from all different angles, so we can figure out what is going on."
"36","  All right, so I saw in your chart that you have previously been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you remember?  Were you ever on any medication for that?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  No, no, I think that that is really good to see and that was, I had seen, you know, maybe some blood pressure concerns, but I have also had seen what we call hyperlipidemia, which just means elevated, like cholesterol and fat levels in your blood.  So, I think maybe the hyperlipidemia is what they were worried about before with that fried chicken."
"39","  Yeah, but no, I totally understand that and I, I hope at least to convey to you that I am someone that, you know, I am a realist.  I don't think, I don't ever believe in cutting anything completely out, what is the point in living, you know, especially with like, really good family fried chicken.  I think we can do everything in moderation when we have certain health goals.  So, I think it is really important that you know, you find someone you feel comfortable with, but also just with realistic goals like I don't think it is a good idea to ever completely get rid of something that really matters a lot to you.  It sounds like that is a really fun family environment to have them on the weekends and having great fried chicken."
"40","  No, I have."
"41","  (Laughs) no, I definitely understand that, I, my mom has mashed potatoes.  The amounts of butter itself she uses are healthy by any means, but I have learned to like and I can't live without them, and so, there are certain ways that my big thing was just getting down on my portion sizes. So..."
"42","  Yeah, I think there is just, there is many ways to approach these things like this and certain priorities.  So, no, it is good, it is good to talk about this.  So, otherwise, in your history, besides you know, maybe besides the diabetes and the two medications, I have not seen any other meds and maybe in the past, some concerns with your, the hyperlipidemia which is those elevated fat and cholesterol levels in your blood, but you are never on medication for this?"
"43","  Okay, okay.  Sometimes, we start patients on a medication we call a statin if we feel like their lipids are up too high.  So, I think it would be a good idea today as well when we check your labs besides that hemoglobin A1c, which shows us your kind of where your diabetes is that, I think it would be a good idea to check your lipid panel."
"44","  Yeah, because sometimes, I mean even, even with patients that have, you know, the, they cut out everything, everything that might give you any cholesterol, already elevated fat issues, we still can sometimes have an issue controlling cholesterol.  So, I, how would you feel if your lipid panel was, it was pretty elevated, if besides just talking about some maybe diet changes, not any, not any diet cut outs or anything, but besides maybe just some different changes we could make in your diet, how would you feel if I thought about starting on a medication for that?"
"45","  Okay, I like to know before I order a bunch of labs or check a lot of things, if someone you know, anyone feels really strongly against a medication or adding any more on or you think it might be too overwhelming, I think before you know, we go down too far any one route, I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page because I don't want to waste your time, I don't want to waste your money, and I don't want to stress you out any more than necessary, (laughs)."
"46","  Yeah, so I think it would be a good idea, yeah check that lipid panel and if need be, it is, it is just good to know in the back of my mind like you if I did think it would be a good idea to start medication that you would be okay with that, but that is a little once again, this is all kind of, I am incorporating a little bit, what I would do maybe further on once we do get your lab results because you never know, maybe they look great, who knows."
"47","  Okay, good.  Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions that we haven't discussed?"
"48","  Okay and never been on any other medications?"
"49","  Okay.  How about..."
"50","  Yeah, yeah, unfortunately, diabetes tends to be especially the type 2, I am not sure how much they talked about it with you.  Sometimes, when we get lucky in life, we can catch, we can catch it somewhat early and sometimes drastic changes, like say, you needed to lose a lot of weight sometimes, that can sometimes help and you won't need to be on medications for as long, but sometimes even then it is kind of just delaying because really, it is a matter of how your pancreas works and some of the vital chemicals that come out, that are affected by just having elevated blood sugars over time that unfortunately, this diagnosis even though, I know it sounds really big and sometimes can be pretty overwhelming at first, it is something that you will have, they will always kind of be in the back of your mind the rest of your life and not necessarily in a bad way.  I think once we get good control and it looks like everything you've been doing the last couple of years, I mean even now you are, like you said you know, your last hemoglobin A1c was below 8, your last blood glucose that you checked, was 200.  So, I think I never want you to be too down on yourself because I think there is, I think it is important to keep in mind that things could always be a lot worse and it doesn't sound like you are insulin dependent at this point.  So..."
"51","  Yeah, no, that is, that is great to know and great to talk about.  So, I think that in itself is a good goal to have.  I know needles and the whole process and getting insulin, it can be very overwhelming and a lot to manage, but let's look at your labs today.  Let's see where we are at and I think there is plenty of options we can try before needing to go that route, and I think if you are open and willing to, I think if we do have to make some hard calls, like say if we want to work on like losing some weight first and maybe getting a little more intensive on checking your blood sugars for the next couple of months just to see where we are at and see if we add on a different medication that is, that wouldn't be insulin, maybe just there is, there is option we can try before having to go there.  I just want you to know that."
"52","  Okay, all right.  So, just to make sure that I have, you know, a clear picture doesn't sound like besides the diabetes and maybe the elevated lipid levels in your blood that you haven't had any other major medical issues, no other medications, no hospitalizations, any surgeries?"
"53","  Oh, knock on wood, (laughs)."
"54","  I see you are wearing glasses.  How are your eyes doing?"
"55","  (Laughs) how often do you see your eyecare provider?"
"56","  Okay, for any certain reasons, just with COVID or"
"57","  I totally."
"58","  Yeah, yeah, now I totally understand.  I think it is really important and something that I hope maybe some of your previous providers had mentioned, but if not, I really want to stress it now.  Diabetes can really affect your vision, it is very, it is a very similar process to what we talked about with your feet and your legs, when you are getting kind of those like, they feel like they are falling asleep or they are a little numb.  That is because of sometimes when your sugar gets a little higher, can more consistently that is what is affecting your peripheral nerves.  It is a similar process that can affect your vision.  So, it is really important, any of my patients that have diabetes, that you are seeing an eye provider pretty consistently, I think what you are saying with this last year in the pandemic, I mean, no, no one can be, life is stressful enough, you know, and then you get a pandemic involved.  So, I think it is totally understandable why you have not seen anyone this last year, but hopefully, I think one of the goals I am going to have is making sure that you get dialed in with an eye care provider in the next couple of months, just to check because there is something called diabetic retinopathy that can really affect your vision."
"59","  From your, from your diabetes, and I and you know vision is huge.  I know and I know that being able to play with your grandkids is a big deal to you.  So, I think it would be really important to if, I know, we want to get you more energy, but we also want to keep that vision intact.  So, I think it would, it would be very important for us for one of our goals to make today to get you into the eye doc to get checked just because they can see with their machines and stuff a lot better and closer up how your eyes are doing."
"60","  Along the lines with that, I don't see any, any previous mention of this in your chart, which is great.  But diabetes, as you know, it is a full body disease, it affects everything and I just want to be thorough as possible.  So, I think it is a good idea when we check your labs, that we also check your kidney function.  Diabetes can really affect your kidneys and I don't see any mention of it before that having any issue with that, which is great.  I just want to get some labs today to see how your kidneys are doing."
"61","  Yeah, yeah, and that is good to know.  Because I think when you are saying that you overall feel pretty fatigued, if you are having to get up a lot during the night that can't help.  So, I think checking out your kidneys, seeing how they are doing, that can also happen, you know as we age and especially with males, your prostate can get a little bit enlarged, and that can also affect you having to get up and use the restroom more than normal.  So have you, do you have any family history of prostate issues?"
"62","  Okay.  Have you, have any of your previous providers done any prostate checks on you and said anything about it feeling enlarged or anything?"
"63","  Okay, okay.  Well, I think we will, we will keep centered on kind of one thing at a time, I don't want to, you know, make a try and attack 10 things at once on this, but I think it is really good to know and I am glad you mentioned that you have been having to get up more to use the restroom during the night, that is really good to know.  I think it, it could be the kidneys, it could be maybe your prostate thing, I think the labs will show us how your kidneys are doing and we can go, we can kind of check that off and see if we need to look any further from then on, but it is just something to keep aware of, especially as males age, the thing about males versus females, we all have different issues that affect us the more as the years progress, so and with males, prostate is a big thing and with females, if you have had children, sometimes that can affect your urinary stream.  So, there is, these are just things we keep in the back of our mind to things that could be affecting, but I think for right now, we will look at your kidney function first on the labs and go from there."
"64","  All right, let's see.  Another thing that I wanted to just ask a couple of more questions about energy.  Have you ever had your thyroid checked?"
"65","  Thankfully, when our excellent nurses take some blood from you, it is just another lab test we can add on your thyroids, this little butterfly shaped organ right here that controls."
"66","  (laughs) yeah.  It can help release some chemicals that actually control and the hormones, a lot of different parts of the body and sometimes as we age, our thyroid can get a little out of whack and that can really affect your energy level.  So, I think that would be a good idea to check as well, but it is a good sign if you've never had any issues in the past.  So, and if anything, if the labs were to come back on that abnormal, we would discuss it more and we could do more education kind of on what all the thyroid does, but in the interest of saving your time and if it comes back normal, I don't think we would have to really discuss it further.  We can save that for another day.  I can't keep it here all day, right? (Laughs)."
"67","  Yeah, but I think I would like to add it onto your labs.  So just, so you know that I am going to check your thyroid.  Also, just where we live and it has been winter, we just don't get as much sunlight here as other parts of the world, so I think vitamin D, checking your vitamin D level would be a really good idea."
"68","  Yeah, because your vitamin D level is low that can really affect your energy."
"69","  Yeah, do you take any supplements?"
"70","  And this is also good to know because sometimes if we mix a lot of different supplements and that even works with food as well, you know, if you are drinking a cup of coffee but then also having a glass of wine right after you know, something is like a stimulant, and something that is a depressant, they kind of equal each other out.  So, it is good to, I really like to ask my patients what all things they are taking, like what kind of supplements or anything else they might be ingesting because that can really affect your levels too.  So, just want to make sure we are, we are hitting it on the nose, like say, if you were only eating, like you cut down your calorie count only like 600 calories a day, that will probably be a big reason why you, why you are feeling pretty tired but it doesn't sound like that is an issue, but that is why"
"71","  Yeah.  Have you noticed any major changes in your weight?"
"72","  Yeah, okay.  Well, I think the best thing we can do is, once we get your labs back and check where everything is, and I don't have you on a scale right now, but I think it would be a good idea, maybe if we can get what your weight is that right now and with your height, we can kind of adjust, we use something called a BMI that can be helpful.  It is not necessarily you know, right on the money, but it can be helpful towards goals because energy as well can improve if we are in like a healthy weight range.  So, I think if, as we are working on getting your diabetes more controlled, I think it would be really helpful in all levels and all aspects of your life, especially with the grandkids and wanting to be more active and to have more energy.  If we need to make some weight loss goals, we can do that as well and there is a lot of ways we can do that, like we have already discussed a little bit, you know, I believe in everything in moderation and I think there is a lot of different approaches we can try.  There is never really, you know, one way fits all and I don't believe in cut-out methods of taking out, you know, take like no more carbs for life.  So, I think we can discuss that further at another, say our next meeting together if we need to what kind of diet changes we can make, and I think there is a lot of things we can discuss there, besides just portion sizes, maybe what a few diet changes like not unnecessarily cutting out that fried chicken, but maybe earlier in the week cutting out some of the other meals that could, making those a little healthier, knowing that you are going to have fried chicken over the weekend, things like that.  I think we can discuss more for some dietary changes and habits at our next meeting if that is all right?"
"73","  All right and kind of just one more little area, I want to focus on, so with your sleeping, I know you said you are getting up a lot during the night to use the restroom.  Has your wife or have you ever been told that you snore?"
"74","  Do you ever wake up in the night kind of like gasping for air or having a hard time breathing?"
"75","  Okay, you ever wake up in the morning with like a headache?"
"76","  Okay, but you said sometimes in the afternoon, you feel like you need to take a nap or you feel really tired."
"77","  Okay, but not like falling asleep out of nowhere, like when you are driving or in a chair?"
"78","  Okay.  Because that is another area, you know, once we get your labs back and look at things, you know, sometimes we can develop something called sleep apnea, which can be a lot of different factors.  Sometimes, it is just the way your, your throat is, sometimes it is the way you sleep if you kind of like close down on your neck, and sometimes if you have excess weight in your upper body, it can kind of compress your breathing, right and so sometimes that can cause you not to get as much oxygen during the night and that can make you really tired during the day.  So, I think that is something we can also think about as well.  That is, especially as we age that gets a lot more common sleep apnea.  I think we have, I think, kind of looking at the diabetes first and trying to see what your labs tell us would be a good idea, but something else keep in the back of our mind is if we, if you are still not feeling like your energy has improved with some of the other changes we make, we might try and look at your sleep a little more because sometimes people need a CPAP machine or they need to go get a sleep study done and if we improve their sleep, their energy goes from, their energy can improve a lot during the day because they are actually getting that, that good eight hours of night where they are actually getting the right amount of oxygen to their brain."
"79","  Yeah, but I think there are some other routes we can look at to check where your energy level is before going down that, before having to get a sleep study done."
"80","  Yeah, all right.  And just to finish up with a couple more, just since this is my first time meeting you, do you have a history of smoking at all?"
"81","  Okay.  How about chewing tobacco?"
"82","  And how about alcohol?"
"83","  Okay and any recreational drug use?"
"84","  (Laughs).  How much coffee you talk, are we talking?"
"85","  Okay, do you ever have tea?"
"86","  Okay.  Now, that is totally reasonable.  I, I think maybe, especially where you are not feeling superenergetic, I think that caffeine probably makes a lot of sense.  I don't love colas or any soda-based items, just because those tend to have a lot of sugars.  So, I think we can help cut out a few things, maybe with getting rid of the cola.  How many would you say you drink a day?"
"87","  Okay, okay, yeah.  Now we can, we can discuss that a little more at our next when we talk about kind of maybe some diet changes we can make next, but this, this is just good for me to write down and be aware of, just kind of what your normal diet normal, diet habits are.  So, it is good to know and any history of substance use at all?"
"88","  Okay, okay.  And any new major life changes, you know, outside of this pandemic that has been causing you any new stress?"
"89","  Good, good.  Any concerns you want to voice to me today about your mood or your mental health at all?"
"90","  (Laughs)."
"91","  (Laughs) that sounds good, sounds good.  Well, if anything ever changes there, I hope you know you can come to me for that."
"92","  Yeah.  Were there any other things you wanted to discuss or bring up?"
"93","   Awesome, yeah.  Well, I think our game plan is going to be just getting those labs that I mentioned.  We might have to have you come back like in a morning, so we can get an am draw that is usually how we get like that lipid panel when you've been fasting, so you can have water or black coffee with no sugar, cream or anything added to it, but otherwise, we try and no food or anything beforehand."
"94","  Yea, so I think we are gonna, I think the game plan is for right now getting your labs, kind of looking at the information that tells us and maybe making some adjustments with your diabetic medication if we need to, but you know, like everything we discussed today, our goal is going to be to get your energy level improved and we have a lot of different ways we can do that."
"95","  Yeah.  It was really nice meeting you today, Freddie.  (Laughs)"
"96","  And we will be in touch once I get those lab results and then we can schedule our next meetings, all right?"
"97","  All right, thank you."
