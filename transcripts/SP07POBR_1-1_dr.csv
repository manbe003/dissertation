"1","  Hi there."
"2","  It's all good.  Telehealth these days; got to learn it.  So how are you feeling today?"
"3","  Yeah.  Tell me, tell me a bit more about that?"
"4","  Tell me what you've been feeling, what sort of symptoms?"
"5","  And about how long has this been going on?"
"6","  Okay.  And has it gotten better, worse, since it first started?"
"7","  Okay, same.  So that cough, congestion, low-grade fever, more tired than usual.  Have you been checking your fevers like with a thermometer or just kind of like you've been feeling warm?"
"8","  Okay.  And how has your health been in the past few months?"
"9","  Sure.  Oh, I was just curious if you had any other colds or any other sort of infections or bugs prior to feeling this way."
"10","  Okay.  My apologies, I'm just going to be taking a few notes while we're talking, so I looked down my screen for a moment."
"11","  I fault up ___ for you.  Have you been vaccinated for COVID?"
"12","  Okay.  And then have you been around anybody recently who has been having similar symptoms, cough, congestion?"
"13","  What is it you do for work?"
"14","  Construction, okay.  Any new projects that you've been working on?"
"15","  I got you.  About how many hours a week are you working?"
"16","  Yeah, sorry it's online.  No, you are fine.  That's unlike a cold.  Is there anything, have you been coughing up anything with it?"
"17","  And can you tell me a bit more about it, the mucus?"
"18","  Sure.  Is it green, white, do you see any…?"
"19","  Clearish whitish okay.  Is it when it comes to consistency? It's thick, really runny?"
"20","  Okay and so to go back to what you've been feeling, what have you noticed that's helped it at all or what have you tried to help with those symptoms?"
"21","  Okay.  And how those have been working?"
"22","  Okay.  You're probably not getting the best sleep of your life?"
"23","  Yeah.  And when was the last time you saw a physician, saw a doctor?"
"24","  I kind of got a brief history from your chart which I just want to run it by you to make sure everything is correct.  It says, no tobacco use.  Do you have any history of tobacco use?"
"25","  Okay.  And then alcohol use, what's that currently?"
"26","  Okay.  What's your poison?  I guess, what's your brand, maybe I should say?"
"27","  I got you.  And just out of curiosity, with your beer drinking has it increased in frequency and amounts or is this pretty much stable, normal for you?"
"28","  Okay.  So kind of along the same lines, just to get your kind of view into my mind and where we're going with this, certainly could be a cold, you know, because you haven’t been vaccinated, there is also concern for possibly COVID infection.  You don't have a smoking history, so no concerns when it comes to any sort of possible cancer or anything like that.  What we can do is, just to make sure that we're on the safe side if you could get you an urgent care or anything like that around you to get a quick COVID swab and I'd also be curious to see what your oxygen level in your blood looks like, just to make sure you know it's not concerning either way.  What are your thoughts?"
"29","  I can't tell 100% just chatting with you.  I certainly wish I could.  The symptoms you have are possibly COVID in the early stages, but I can't say definitively until we have some sort of swab or test done."
"30","  Honestly with the way we're talking right now, I can't make promises either way, it does just seem to be a nasty cold and I definitely want to make sure, more I would want to catch it if it does happen to be COVID just to make sure you are taken care of.  And do you happen to live with your girlfriend?"
"31","  Okay, and is she vaccinated as well?"
"32","  I got you.  Out of curiosity, do you have any sort of questions or hesitancies about getting the COVID vaccine?"
"33","  Sure and that's entirely understandable.  We all got real busy schedules and tons of things that we're juggling.  If this does happen to be just a common cold, I would encourage you as well, when you get a chance to just go get a shot.  Most if not all pharmacies offer it for free.  You can schedule it, so you pop in an ounce."
"34","  If you do happen to have COVID they usually don't give you the shots.  I guess, it's kind of one of those things that will have to do in a sequential process.  Check to see if you got COVID, if you don't have COVID, wait around to make sure that the cold goes away and then we can certainly get you your first shot and get you that protection in place."
"35","  And another thing as well, just because it hasn’t been quite some time since you've seen a physician or a medical provider, would you be willing to establish care with myself or with someone else?"
"36","  Yeah, I mean we certainly can.  I just wanted to make sure that we got your first concern taken care of since that's what it was listed for.  And so, if you wouldn’t mind, we could schedule for a followup appointment to do a bit more of an in depth history and physical?"
"37","  Yeah.  It sounds like you might have a little bit of a concern there?"
"38","  Sure.  And I can entirely understand that.  I'm not 100% sure if we have any sort of weekend hours or evening hours.  Those might be something that we could possibly see to help get you in and it's just one of those things to check and make sure.  I think you do have a few years under your belt and so we want to make sure that you are in tip-top shape when it comes to your blood pressure, blood sugar, make sure that your cholesterol is within reasonable limits, just because those things were kind of things that could be going on in the background and be getting worse.  We want to catch them before they do get worse.  I don't want you to have to end up with diabetes or high blood pressure and on three medications. "
"39","  Yeah, so what I would recommend right now and I can even look at up for you, if you would like, is to get to an urgent care.  You don't necessarily have to go to an emergency room or anything like that to be able to get a COVID swab.  That's our first step.  And then from there, I will have you either call back here and I'll have my phone with me, so they should be able to get the results back to you relatively soon.  I mean, if it even makes it easier for you, you could just go pick up one of those rapid COVID tests at a pharmacy where you kind of do it yourself.  Those are pretty accurate, but not as accurate as the swab that you can get from some sort of medical clinic.  That's step one."
"40","  Step two, get you feeling better.  DayQuil is going to be real good.  If you're having a lot of congestion, I would recommend something called, have you ever heard of Flonase or fluticasone?"
"41","  Sure.  So and that's something that we can take care of later.  It's just a nasal spray that helps to kind of keep things open in there, but if you don't want to adding certain medications or anything like that at this time, I totally understand.  But other than that the big things that are going to help you are sleep, making sure that you stay hydrated.  You don't have to pound fluids, but just making sure you're getting enough of water in you."
"42","  Yeah, water, even a bit of Gatorade or you know something like that."
"43","  Yeah, so what we can do is, I can have the office reach out to you a little bit later.  It doesn't have to be immediate.  We can just take care of this first concern that you have of getting you feeling better and you're exactly right, water, rest, and then either a do-it-yourself or go in and see somebody and it should be pretty quick."
"44","  How does that sound?"
"45","  I know.  I wish we could solve everything right here and right now.  It would be a lot better if we were in person, but thank you COVID.  And it's a good thing that we have significant others that keep guys like you and I from dying too early.  So I will get those things taken care of for you and I'll have the office give you a call soon to schedule appointments and hopefully we will see you in person."
"46","  All right.  Any other questions or concerns Tom?"
"47","  Okay.  Well I hope you are feeling better and I'll see you soon."
"48","  Bye bye."
"49","  Sure, so at the bottom right corner you're going to see a leave button."
"50","  Yeah."
