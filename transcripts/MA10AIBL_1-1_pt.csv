"1","  Okay, thank you."
"2","  Yes."
"3","  Okay."
"4","  I am doing great today, just a little tired, but held up in Airtime, doing good."
"5","  Yes, I generally, I try to get into an office between four and six months, but it's been about a year since I've been in, so I wanted to check in to make sure that everything is going okay."
"6","  Just, just feeling tired, you know, in terms of it seems that at the end of the day I'm just exhausted and so I just want to make sure that there's nothing else going on other than my diabetes."
"7","  For long periods of time, but I have an office job, so I'm not on my feet, you know eight hours out of a day, but standing, you know, beyond maybe 10 or 20 minutes can be a challenge sometimes."
"8","  Yes, somewhere around those numbers, yes."
"9","  Thus far I've been doing okay.  I've been taking my medication on a regular basis every, not every two weeks, I mean that is the dose, but I try to take the medication on a regular basis, yes."
"10","  Medication is 500 mg of metformin twice a day and 10 mg of glipizide twice a day and so, that's all I take right now."
"11","  As usual.  My wife prepares the meals and so generally, and for breakfast I will have coffee with cream and sugar and eggs and hash browns with butter, and then at lunchtime, because I work downtown, it's closer to skip over to McDonald's and pick up a cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger with fries and a soda.  And then my wife fixed dinner and it is generally prepared by the time I get home and she generally makes steaks and potatoes and I'll have a soda and a bowl of ice cream with -- for dessert.  And then on a weekend she prepares fried chicken and so…"
"12","  Like generally my diet you know day after week after week, and so thus far it's been working."
"13","  Well, I have been trying to increase my activities, but I walk anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes twice a day.  I know I should do more, but that's really all I have time for, really."
"14","  Yes, I have.  I generally take it in the morning, you know before doing anything else and, but the numbers have been climbing a little bit and this morning it was 215 and just, you know, just climbing into the yellow area now, so that's another area of concern."
"15","  I don't know.  I haven’t been taking my sugar level then you know."
"16","  I would say I'm about a 5."
"17","  5 or 6, you know, it's not a perfect situation and not debilitating to me right now.  So I would say a 5 or 6."
"18","  That's a good question.  I don't, I really don't have any, any ideas.  I'm not crazy about taking insulin, so if you have any recommendations, I'm kind of open to that, to those suggestions that would improve my diabetes."
"19","  No, I'm just tired and I just realized that at the end of the day I'm just tired and it feels like over the last six months I'm just feeling more tired than I previously had.  And the other thing that is motivating me to wanting to see you today is that I have three grandkids that my wife watches during the day, but when I get home they want to play with me and I just do not have the energy to keep up with them, so that's a challenge."
"20","  Just a little more frequent urination, that's about it."
"21","  Okay."
"22","  I would say that's probably a good starting point.  Again, I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't really know, you know, all of the complications around it, you know, the effects of diabetes.  So I would say, yes, you are pretty right on with that."
"23","  Oh well, that would be a real challenge for me right now, because you know of my work schedule, I just don't have a lot of time to, you know, to make some major changes and then my wife, she prepares all the meals and so, you know, without having her involved probably with preparing meals is, you know is a real challenge."
"24","  That seems reasonable, yeah."
"25","  Okay, that's reasonable, yeah."
"26","  Okay.  Okay, that sounds good.  Are there any side effects to increasing my medication that much, I mean we're talking about a 1000 mg a day?"
"27","  Okay."
"28","  I think I would feel more comfortable you know having the labs done and then an analysis of adding in, you know, going forward from the information that the labs provide."
"29","  Yes, yes, that's good."
"30","  That's true, yes."
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Well, you know, again, I'm just concerned about, you know, am I just becoming an old man and you know are going to die soon or whatever, so whatever measures that I can take that would improve my health condition is much appreciated.  So those are the only concerns I have at the present time.  Yes, I think your recommendations for maybe increasing the medication and things like that hopefully would help."
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Okay, all right.  That sounds like a plan."
"35","  Okay, thank you."
