"1","  Hey, Tom can you hear me?"
"2","  No, you are good.  It is nice to meet you, my name is Casey, I am a first year medical student at UW."
"3","  How are you doing today?"
"4","  Yeah, most people don’t come to see me when they are feeling a 100% so tell me what’s going on?"
"5","  Okay.  Well, thanks for coming and seeing me.  Tell me about this cold what does it consist of, what have you been feeling?"
"6","  Okay and you’ve had that both of those for the whole week?"
"7","  Okay.  When it started, did it come on pretty quickly?"
"8","  Okay. Have you had a cold like this in the past or ever felt like this?"
"9","  Okay."
"10","  Sure, sure, we’ll try to get that sorted out best we can.  So cough, I have written down the cough, you’ve had a fever, a little bit of a fever this week?"
"11","  And fatigue, you’ve been feeling extra tired which I guess is pretty typical of a cold."
"12","  Are you vaccinated for COVID?"
"13","  Okay.  Have your symptoms improved at all since a week ago or they just continue to get worse?"
"14","  Okay.  Any muscle aches or pains with the cold?"
"15","  Okay.  I have it written down, so I just want to confirm with you, you haven’t had any difficulty breathing, no loss of taste or smell?"
"16","  Okay.  Have you ever had COVID in the past?"
"17","  Okay.  Have you done anything that’s helped make this feel better?"
"18","  Okay and that’s helping a little bit?"
"19","  Have you ever been tested for COVID either recently or in the past, like nose swab?"
"20","  Okay.  We’ll probably going to want to get you swab to make sure it is not COVID.  There are some things that we can do if it is COVID, however mostly if it is just going to be managing the symptoms so, and then you are just keeping an eye on yourself as well.  Unfortunately, it is one of those things that just like a lot of other things have to run its course but we do want to see, test to see if you have it so have you ever gone to like one of the drive through testing facilities?"
"21","  Okay.  I can give you in the after visit summary a printout to have your address on like some nearby facilities to get you tested."
"22","  You said it was your girlfriend that wanted you to check out or your wife?"
"23","  Your girlfriend, okay.  I think she is a good advocate for you and it is good to get this checked out.  So we’ll get you tested and you feel like the DayQuil has been good at kind of managing your symptoms?"
"24","  All right.  How have you been sleeping?"
"25","  Okay, and food and liquid intake is okay?"
"26","  Okay, that’s good, that’s good to hear.  Other than that, any other concerns that you have or I guess, yeah, concerns related to this illness or anything else?"
"27","  Okay.  Does that plan sound good to you, I know there is not too much else I can do but I can get you definitely on the right path to see if you have COVID and then just encourage you to keep resting, drinking fluids and managing those symptoms with DayQuil as needed.  How often are you taking the DayQuil?"
"28","  Okay, that’s totally appropriate.  If you do develop any like increased aches or pains like ibuprofen is helpful for some of those body aches and then I guess warning signs to look out for if you do develop severe difficulty breathing or your temperature really spikes, those are some red flags to maybe consider getting some more help.  I am glad to hear that you haven’t had any difficulty breathing and that your fevers are pretty low grade.  So we’ll send you that after visit summary with testing sites near you.  You have insurance correct?"
"29","  Okay so your insurance will make sure it covers the whole testing, I don’t want any surprise charges for you and that’s sounds like a good plan?"
"30","  All right Tom, so there is nothing more I can do, I am sorry you are feeling so crummy but we’re going to get to the bottom of this."
"31","  You are so welcome.  You have a good one."
"32","  Good bye."
