"1","  Hi, Tom"
"2","  Hello, my name is Ariel.  I am a first-year medical student.  I’ll be interviewing you today for your appointment.  Can you hear me all right?"
"3","  All right.  How you’re doing today?"
"4","  Okay, well, I am glad you’re here and we can try and figure out what’s going on.  So, tell me a bit about your symptoms?"
"5","  Tom?"
"6","  No worries."
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Okay.  So, when did all these symptoms first start?"
"9","  Week ago."
"10","  All right and have you have noticed any fever what you say?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Okay, so you measure your temperate which is 99."
"13","  Okay and when you taken DayQuil, was that helpful and make you feel better?"
"14","  Okay, okay and so you’ve had a bit of a cough it’s productive, it’s bringing up some stuff.  How about your sinuses, any congestion?"
"15","  Okay, sore throat?"
"16","  No.  Have you had any difficulty breathing?"
"17","  No shortness of breath, okay good.  I know the big question everyone is thinking about is COVID now.  Have you had any exposures that you know of?"
"18","  You don’t know, okay.  Have you had any COVID test recently?"
"19","  Okay, okay and have you been vaccinated for COVID?"
"20","  No, okay.  So, of course that’s something they want to consider.  There are lot of drive up testing or drive through testing places that maybe the easiest for you to confirm a COVID diagnosis, but we can keep talking about your symptoms now and seeing how we can get your feeling better.  So, do you feel that generally your symptoms have been stable, improving, worsening?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  You expect to get over it, that’s what you said, okay."
"23","  Okay, so this is similar to past colds that you’ve had."
"24","  Yeah.  Okay, good to hear.  Any muscle aches?"
"25","  No joint, no muscle."
"26","  Okay, any changes in your like bowel movements or urination?"
"27","  Okay."
"28","  No recent changes.  Okay and I also see you are no loss of taste or smell?"
"29","  Okay.  Have you noticed any rashes on your skin anywhere?"
"30","  No rashes, okay.  So, you seem like this you figure this is a COVID, it will improve, but your girlfriend was more concerned?"
"31","  Okay."
"32","  Here you are.  Well, it’s good that we’re talking.  Since it’s been a while you are likely due for some cancer screenings.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?"
"33","  Okay, well the recommendation is to start 45 and 50, especially if you have family history.  If you’re interested in having some type of colon cancer screening, it doesn’t have to be a colonoscopy, I can put in a referral order and we can talk about some options if you’re open to that but also."
"34","  Yeah, so the colonoscopy is a gold standard because you know they go in and if there is something that needs to be biopsied that can be done right there, but there are other options like it’s called the Cologuard or if it’s stool test where essentially you collect your stool and mail it into the lab and they evaluate it.  If blood is seen or something questionable seen, you will then need a colonoscopy, but you may not and so then you would only need to do this stools test, are you interested in either of those?"
"35","  Okay, I can start the paperwork for a Cologuard and then."
"36","  Yeah, a kit will be sent to your house where you can collect your stool and then send it off?"
"37","  Well, good it’s you know it’s one of the things."
"38","  Yeah, yeah.  I am glad to hear that."
"39","  Have you had any recent vaccinations like the flu?"
"40","  No, okay.  It is recommended that you get the COVID vaccines.  Is there a reason you haven’t so far?"
"41","  Yeah, yeah, I mean I understand some hesitancy at this point millions and millions people have had the vaccine and it is quite safe and it can actually reduce the severity if you do get COVID, so I recommend it.  You can get it at most pharmacies now, so something you can think about, okay and then any other like general health concerns that you wanted to bring up to talk about?"
"42","  No, you mentioned the diarrhea as starting three years ago."
"43","  Is that something you are worried about or?"
"44","  Okay.  Well, I am glad that you’re going to do the Cologuard then.  You know, having diarrhea occasionally could be very normal, but it’s good that we’re evaluating more.  The other thing I would recommend is some blood work just a general panel to see where you’re at with cholesterol and especially if you’re thinking about stool like maybe if you’re having any blood loss and that way we can check your blood levels, iron levels, it’s just generally good to see a panel of that since it’s been a while.  If you are open to it, I can put in the orders and you can come in when you are free to the lab, all right.  Put in the general orders, I am glad that we’re getting all of this taken care of.  As for your cold, I think continuing with DayQuil as needed, it sounds like it’s fairly mild, but I would like you to get a COVID test if possible if you’re comfortable with that?"
"45","  Okay, good.  Is she concerned that it’s COVID?"
"46","  Okay.  Well, you can get tested and you will be able to get your result within 48 hours.  So, it would be helpful.  I think if things continue improving and you’re treating it with like over-the-counter medications, I am happy for you to continue with that, but if it worsens or doesn’t get better within the next few days, you can follow-up and we can talk about it further."
"47","  I think it’s wrapping up things that I want to talk to you about.  Do you have any more questions or things you want to discuss?"
"48","  Okay.  Well, I am glad that we could talk about some of these things today, glad you came in virtually."
"49","  That’s very kind of you saying."
"50","  All right, thank you.  Have a nice day."
