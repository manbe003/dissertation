"1","  It says press Alt-A."
"2","  Okay."
"3","  I’m Freddy."
"4","  Freddy."
"5","  He/him will be fine with me."
"6","  I’ve delayed having my diabetes checked, I was supposed to be in months ago and I didn’t."
"7","  I’m tired, I have a distinct lack of energy relative to a month ago."
"8"," And so that's of some concern to me, I feel like my numbers are getting a little up. I was supposed to come in but previous provider was harping me so much about diet.  Well, I feel like I’ve been taking care of my diet okay, I guess I didn’t wanted to go back."
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Say that again please?"
"11","  Okay, I guess."
"12","  I said okay, I guess."
"13","  No, I don’t think so."
"14","  I mean I pee a lot.  I am 60."
"15","  I don’t think that I can narrow it down quite that much."
"16","  Yeah."
"17","  It's okay, yeah, maybe every other week I realize that I missed a dose but other than that and that the meds seem to work.  When I first came in, I was first diagnosed about eight years ago and I had ______ once and never again since then I would have missed."
"18","  No, no."
"19","  So that was ___."
"20","  I don’t think so."
"21","  That was a question?"
"22","  Coffee with cream and sugar for breakfast, eggs and hash brown with a pat of butter, lunch I usually just go to McDonald's get myself a double cheeseburger, fries and a large sprite and then when I come home my wife makes dinner and that’s usually meat and potato or ice cream for dessert and she usually makes fried chicken over the weekend."
"23","  They were just trying to start me from scratch and you know give some sort of bland, I didn’t feel like I was being treated like a human being.  Well, this correlates with that, so we’ll make you into this person who doesn’t have diabetes, I’m not, I don’t want to live a different life, I can you know I can cut some of the skin off the fried chicken you know but when you tell me I can't have this then I said okay, I’ll die.  I don’t mean to melodramatic, you know, there are certain things that are I feel now I am left out and I feel like I’m getting talked down to and I’m not a child."
"24","  Couple of times a week.  I checked it this morning."
"25","  It's 215.  It's started climbing into the yellow lately."
"26","  I would say probably over the last month or so that you know I realized I can’t put off this appointment just because I didn’t wanted to go outside.  I do want to take care of myself, I don’t want to you know let my occasional emotional reactions.  So I’m here with that but I also have to, you know, be absolutely right with my gut to live a certain way."
"27","  So, you know I took a pause but obviously the numbers are climbing again.  So, the numbers are important and I know you know that, so."
"28","  I don’t want to have to go unemployed."
"29","  There is a lot of background noise."
"30","  Sure, sure, okay."
"31","  No, not familiar with that."
"32","  Does it hurt?"
"33","  That sounds like a potentially helpful tool."
"34","  I try to check it often enough to get a sense of what it is, you know, I’m never eager to make myself bleed, it’s an unpleasant part of the day."
"35","  Okay."
"36","  I’ll give you a definite maybe on that."
"37","  Of course, yeah."
"38","  Maybe."
"39","  That sounds productive."
"40","  Okay, yeah."
"41","  No, no."
"42","  No, I think I covered everything I wanted to talk about."
