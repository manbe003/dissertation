"1","  Ok. There we go.  I can see you now.  Hi, how are you today?"
"2","  Okay.  I am doing well.  Thanks.  Thank you for meeting with me virtually today."
"3","  So, Mr. Jones, I understand that we needed to talk about some fatigue that you have been having.  Can you tell me more?"
"4","  Yeah, I am sorry.  You have been feeling some fatigue and I am glad that you came in to talk about that today.  So, I want to find out more about how you have been feeling?  Can you characterize that fatigue more.  Is it like more like shortness of breath or more like just feeling sleepy.  Tell me more about how you have been feeling?"
"5","  Okay.  Any other symptoms you have noticed anything like comes to mind how ________ I want to ask you about you but anything I would say has been abnormal for you."
"6","  Okay.  Okay.  Anything else."
"7","  Okay.  Few more questions for you.  Have you noticed increasing shortness of breath when you exert yourself like for example when you walk up a flight of stairs do you feel more shorter breath than you have in the past."
"8","  Okay.  Have you noticed any shortness of breath when laying down flat at night."
"9","  Okay.  Any swelling in your legs."
"10","  Okay.  Then couple of questions about your sleep.  What is your sleep look like."
"11","  Okay.  Do you feel rested when you wake up in the morning."
"12","  Okay and that seems to correlate with the number of times that you need to get up to urinate at night."
"13","  Okay.  Has your wife ever noticed that you snore.  Are you snorer?"
"14","  Okay.  So, she hasn’t mentioned anything."
"15","  Okay.  So, few more questions about the urination.  When did these frequent getting up at night to urinate, when did that start"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Have you noticed a weak stream with urination as well or may be like trouble getting started or dribbling at the end of urination."
"18","  Okay.  Have you noticed any pain with urination or any blood in the urine?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Sure.  Yes.  So it’s totally normal for men of your age to experience some urinary symptoms.  A lot of the time that can be caused by what we call benign prostatic hyperplasia, which do you know what that is?"
"21","  Okay.  So, it’s not prostate cancer.  Sorry, let me back up.  So yes.  It’s common for older men to experience a larger prostate causing these symptoms, weak stream and frequent urination at night because the prostate is a gland that surrounds urethra and as it gets bigger with age it can kind of squeeze on a little bit and make it hard to empty your bladder.  So I am thinking that might be a list of component of what’s going on here interrupting with your sleep and making you feel tired.  Have you ever been diagnosed with this enlarged prostate in the past?"
"22","  Okay.  Yeah.  So we can do another examination today just check on the size of that.  I would also like to check PSA and just get an assessment of what your cancer risk is there as well."
"23","  Another thing that can cause frequent urination as you probably know is diabetes and it does look like your hemoglobin A1c has been creeping up in recent years and I have on your chart here that you are taking metformin and glipizide.  Have you been able to take that consistently?"
"24","  Sure.  And it can be hard to take your medications consistently every day a lot of people struggle with that as well.  Do you monitor your blood sugar at home."
"25","  Okay and what has it been ranging."
"26","  Okay.  Alright.  So we will recheck your hemoglobin A1c again today.  It’s possible that we might add another medication to get your diabetes under better control and see if that helps with the urinary symptoms as well."
"27","  Excuse me.  One moment.  I am just making a list of all the things that we need to do at the end of today’s visit and then I would like to check your kidney function as well.  Sometimes over time diabetes can stress our kidneys so we want to check to make sure how your kidneys are doing."
"28","  Okay and then the other thing that can sometimes cause fatigue Mr. Jones is poor mood.  Things like depression and anxiety.  How do you feel like your mood has been over the past year?"
"29","  Okay, alright.  Good.  Well, it looks like we have a plan for today I want to do some tests to look for benign prostatic hyperplasia to see if your diabetes might be contributing and then look at your kidney function as well.  Well, does that sound like a plan to you?"
"30","  Is there anything else that you were hoping to go over at today’s visit.  Anything else you want to talk about?"
"31","  So just to make sure I understand the question.  You are curious if this is the beginning of the end getting fatigued.  Okay.  Well you know I understand that concern.  It can be hard to see yourself slow down especially it sounds like you want to have energy to play with your grandkids and you are just not getting that energy, but this is totally normal and this is part of the normal aging process.  There are some medical things that could be contributing and we will check on those today.  If there is anything that is worrisome, we have some medications that can treat that you know and certainly follow up on that appropriately as needed, but just because you are experiencing low energy doesn’t necessarily mean that you are imminently dying.  I want to reassure you that I am not seeing anything scary so one of the things I was thinking about when you said fatigue I was wondering if you might be in heart failure.  I asked some questions about that and I don’t think that’s the case.  So I wouldn’t worry."
"32","  We will do some tests today though to make absolutely sure."
"33","  Okay.  We will check in on that and then why don’t we schedule a followup meeting in two weeks from now to go over your labs and that way we can talk about what the best way to manage those results says because as you know we can manage diabetes with medication we can also make some modifications to diet and exercise level so I would like to go over those, but I would like to have those lab results first prior to that meeting."
"34","  Okay and then I am just taking a look at some items to health maintenance as well.  It looks like you are due for some other routine screenings so I would like to take a look at your lipid panel to see what your cholesterol has been doing and then your electrolytes as well.  So these are just routine labs and then maybe if it’s how would you feel about coming in for an in-person visit for your two week followup because I am also seeing here that there is some vaccinations that you are due for as well, the pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza vaccine as well so if you came in to do an in-person visit in two weeks so we could you those vaccines as well."
"35","  Okay.  Alright.  So then why don’t you stop by the lab at some point within the next week or so and then I will see you in-person in two weeks from now to go over your results."
"36","  Alright, sounds good."
"37","  Of course.  Take care.  Bye, bye."
