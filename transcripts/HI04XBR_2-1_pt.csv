"37","  I do not get dizzy."
"38","  It is a gradual throughout the day.  I mean, at the end of the day and for my work day, I just feel exhausted, you know, just low energy.  So it is not a specific time that I, you know, recognize that I am tired.  It is just that generally at the end of the day, I just feel exhausted.  I want to sit down and, you know, probably want to take a nap, but I do not.  Hmm hmm."
