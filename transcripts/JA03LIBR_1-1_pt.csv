"1","  Hello."
"2","  I am doing great today.  How are you?"
"3","  Well.  I have diabetes and probably in the last 2-3 weeks, I have just been experiencing a little more tiredness, need to take more breaks during the course of the day and also frequent urination."
"4","  I would say probably. I know that I really started paying attention probably two or three weeks ago."
"5","  Just feeling tired, I mean I need to take more frequent breaks at work even though I am sitting all day.  I just seem to need to get away from the computer and just take a break from it and then when I get home I have three grandkids that my wife watches during the course of the day, and when I walk through the door, they want to romp and play and whatever, and I just do not have the energy to kind of keep up with them and so that is a little concern to me."
"6","  Hmm hmm."
"7","  I would say like a combination of both."
"8","  Uh, I think it is going well.  I, you know, I know that my numbers are getting a little bit higher and so right now it is about 7.9.  I mean it is not 8 yet, so I am not really concerned but I just know that they are from the previous year was like 7.6 and now 7.9, so"
"9","  Hmm hmm."
"10","  I take both medications twice a day, generally in the morning.  You know, with breakfast and then in the afternoon and evening when I come in, I take them.  Hmm hmm."
"11","  No, no."
"12","  Yes, I do.  First thing in the morning before, you know, consuming any liquids or food, I take my blood, I mean, glucose and this morning it was like 215."
"13","  Hmm hmm.  "
"14","  Yes.  Hmm hmm."
"15","  No, no, not really.  Hmm hmm."
"16","  Uh  Instead of going to the restroom maybe two or three times a day at work, I am now going like six times a day, and then it is slightly interrupted, once at night I have to get up maybe twice during the course of the night, and so that is that is really concerning.  Hmm."
"17"," No"
"18","  No."
"19","  Well, I think I could empty my bladder, but it does not seem to occur that way, you know, because maybe an hour, hour and a half I have to go again, you know, so urinate as much as I can at that particular time.  And, so it is kind of hard to tell whether or not my bladder is completely emptied at that time that I go."
"20","  No, no, never"
"21","  Hmm."
"22","  No."
"23","  No."
"24","  Feel normal.  Hmm."
"25","  No."
"26","  Hmm."
"27","  Yes, hmm."
"28","  I am willing to try that.  What percentage or is it, you know, 50% or 100% you are going to increase it?"
"29","  Okay, okay."
"30","  Okay, okay."
"31","  Well.  .You know it is just that I am just really concerned about the tiredness and the urination and so I wanted to you know, it has been about a year since I have been in.  I normally would come in every four to six months, but because of work and other commitments I have not been able to come in so that is the reason I am here primarily is to manage, you know, my diabetes with medication and hopefully have more energy throughout the course of the day and in the evening.  So."
"32","  Okay, well, I know I am getting up at age and so am I just slowing down or am I an old man about ready to die, you know, so that has been a concern. (Laughing)"
"33","  Okay, okay.  Well since my last visit about a year ago, I have been trying to increase my exercise, walking 10-15 minutes about twice a week with my wife so and that has helped.  I do feel I am better after doing that, so I appreciate you recommending that."
"34","   No, No, if you will just send me a notice of where I could do the lab work and then we will set up an appointment to meet again."
"35","  Okay, alright.  Thank you so much Emma."
"36","  Okay, you too."
"37","  Bye."
