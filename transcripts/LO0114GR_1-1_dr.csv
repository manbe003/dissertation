"1","  Hi Freddie."
"2","  How is it going?"
"3","  So tell me what brings you in today to the clinic?"
"4","  Yeah."
"5","  Oh, I am sorry to hear that.  Tell me a little bit more about when you started feeling tired and what your symptoms have been like."
"6","  Gotcha.  Have you ever had symptoms like this before in the past?"
"7","  Okay.  Any other health concerns you have today?"
"8","  Okay, Gotcha.  Have you had any shortness of breath?"
"9","  Okay.  Any chest palpitations?"
"10","  Okay.  How do you feel like your mood has been in the last few months?"
"11","  Yeah?"
"12","  Gotcha.  Any fevers?"
"13","  Okay.  Have you noticed, have you when like going on walks or going on stairs and finding that that has been harder than usual?"
"14","  Gotcha.  Okay, how many hours of sleep are you getting each night?"
"15","  Okay.  Is that normal for you?"
"16","  Yes.  Do you know if you snore?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yes, she hasn’t complained recently, so hopefully not…"
"19","  Yes.  Gotcha, okay.  And have you had any recent blood in your stool or when you cough any blood coming out of your mouth?"
"20","  Nothing like that, okay.  And then can you remind me if you smoke cigarettes?"
"21","  Okay, gotcha, okay.  Would you remember when your last colonoscopy was?"
"22","  Okay, so you are not sure if you have had a colonoscopy?"
"23","  Yeah, okay.  Okay, that’s good to know.  Anything else about your symptoms that I should know about, maybe I haven’t asked about?"
"24","  Gotcha, yeah.  Oh, I have a few ideas.  So, we will see.  We might have to sort of run some tests, but I also want to touch on your diabetes a little bit because I know you said that it has been about a maybe a year since you have talked about diabetes to the doctor.  So I know you are on your metformin and your glipizide, have you still been taking those?"
"25","  Okay.  Do you take your blood sugars every day?"
"26","  Okay.  Well do you remember what they ran when you take them?"
"27","  Okay.  Was that before you ate any food?"
"28","  Okay.  Is that pretty standard what you have been seeing?"
"29","  Gotcha, okay.  Have you noticed you have been urinating more?"
"30","  Gotcha, okay.  Any pain with urination?"
"31","  Okay.  How many times in the evening are you getting up to go to the bathroom?"
"32","  Okay, gotcha.  And do you feel like you are able to fully empty your bladder when you go to the bathroom?"
"33","  Okay, good.  Okay, and have you had any issues or things you worry about with metformin would be some patients get diarrhea and an upset stomach, have you had any concerns for that?"
"34","  Okay, good.  All righty.  Well, I will go ahead and share my Docs, if you don’t have any other kind of questions or things you wanted to mention as kind of what I want to do moving forward."
"35","  So I think, I guess we will start more with your diabetes.  It does seem like based on the blood sugars you are telling me that your diabetes is getting a little bit farther to the point that we, I would say, we need to make some changes, but we need a little bit better idea of how you are doing and we haven’t gotten an A1c, it has been about a year.  So, we do a blood test today and check your hemoglobin A1c.  And just as a reminder, the goal is 7.  And the last time we checked you are actually at 7.9.  So, we had so much to do last year and I think we might have unfortunately kind of continued to just stray away from our goal.  So we would check your A1c and then based on that we will kind of think about maybe potentially we could increase your metformin or maybe will end up adding additional medication just depending on what that number shows at."
"36","  Yeah.  The other thing we have been…"
"37","  Yeah.  The other thing we would recommend would be potentially some diet changes and exercise.  But I think what we need to really address before we get too crazy down that road would also be your fatigue, because I don’t want you exercising if there is something else going on that’s making you really tired.  So to address that, I would want to get a complete blood count to see if there is any anemia is going on and then also at your age you are a good candidate to get that colonoscopy screening, which would help us see if you have any pre-cancers or even cancers in your colon and oftentimes you can be completely symptom-free and have a colon, you know, pre-cancer or cancer.  And about colonoscopy is we can go in there and we can take it right out as soon as we see it.  And so, I think that would be helpful in figuring out, just in case that’s something contributing to the fatigue.  And even if it’s not, it’s very important to address the cancer is really possible."
"38","  So I think plan overall then would be some bloodwork that will help us with both your fatigue and with your diabetes and then order or refer you for a colonoscopy and then we will be in touch based on the results of both those things, that more soon it will be the better result."
"39","  Does that sound okay?"
"40","  Good.  Any questions?"
"41","  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Yeah and I mean I do think, oh I guess I will start, I should mention this part of the plan would be helpful if you can ask your wife if you have been snoring, because I am a little worried.  I mean, six hours of sleep isn’t ideal, which is what you mentioned you were getting and certainly you are drinking coffee in the afternoon would be, could contribute to that.  That sounds like you normally get six hours though.  So that’s a little…"
"42","  Yeah, yeah and that’s okay and that is part of the studies too, with the bloodwork we got to also look iron and iron deficiencies can be associated with restless legs syndrome.  That can also help point out if maybe you had some issues with your restless legs, which could be due to sleep issues.  So I think ask your wife if you are snoring because, if you are snoring pretty hard we could refer you to a sleep study and we could see if you have a little bit of sleep apnea and that is something that causes a lot of fatigue for people."
"43","  Perfect.  That sounds like a plan.  You got some homework and I got some homework."
"44","  All righty.  Well, I guess you can leave or resume when you feel comfortable Freddie."
"45","  Yes, nice to meet you."
