"1","  Hi, Mr. Johnson.  I can’t hear you, I don’t think your audio is connected.  I can’t hear you still."
"2","  Yes, sounds good."
"3","  Good, it worked."
"4","  That’s like good.  It always seemed to happen sometimes, but."
"5","  Yeah, hi, Mr. Johnson.  My name is Dr. Hummel ________ how to pronounce and I will be seeing you today.  Do you prefer to go by Mr. Johnson or another name?"
"6","  Alright, nice to meet you, Tom…ha, ha.  So, I heard a little bit about what brings you but why you Tom you kind of what you want to accomplish today?"
"7","  Yeah, so, step back a little bit and see kind of what symptoms exactly are you feeling and for how long?"
"8","  And what color of the phlegm that you cough up?"
"9","  Okay, and have you previously had COVID or had the COVID vaccine?"
"10","  Okay, alright.  Do you have anyone you’ve been around who could expose you to COVID?"
"11","  Okay and is your girlfriend feeling ill like you all are having similar symptoms?"
"12","  And if you had a fever at all?"
"13","  Okay, and any difficulty breathing at all?"
"14","  Do you have any history of any problems with your lungs or any respiratory problems?"
"15","  Okay.  Alright and kind of why if you should get the COVID test today just to see if kind of rule that out and see if that’s kind of causing these symptoms.  Have you been sleeping more at all?"
"16","  And any loss of taste or smell?"
"17","  Okay, alright.  Well, I mean as you probably seen on the news and everything COVID is pretty prevalent even if you don’t know a direct exposure.  When you have some symptoms that to me are could be like COVID but could be like many other things, it could just be seasonal changes or allergies, but I do think that it is appropriate just to get tested just so we know, we can confirm or whether you do or do not have COVID if that works for you and easily done today if you are willing to do that.  We could also send it off for a couple of other respiratory viruses as well, it’s not flu season right now, but you know just with change in ___________ we could test a couple of viruses at the same time if that works."
"18","  Alright.  Have you taken any medications for the cold symptoms at all?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Does that seem to alleviate any of the symptoms or help or?"
"21","  Okay, alright and any like sinus pain or sinus pressure?"
"22","  And do you smoke tobacco at all?"
"23","  Okay, drink alcohol?"
"24","  Okay.  Smoke marijuana at all?"
"25","  Any other drug use?"
"26","  Okay, alright.  So, sounds like pretty much taking good care of your lungs as well.  So, alright.  Was there and you said you haven’t been to a doctor in 10 years, was there anything else you kind of want to clarify today or kind of just get established with care again?"
"27","  Yeah, and I think I can come in to take your blood pressure just to check to make sure adequate _______________ with that and we also could run some labs that would just take involve like a little stick in your arm to draw some blood and we could run some labs just to check to make sure things like your sugar and your lipids like a fatty parts in the blood to see if those are like where we would expect them to be and if they are not then we’ll call and set up another appointment to see where to go from there with medications or other dietary or lifestyle changes that we would suggest.  Those are kind of just typical labs that we would do just to check on annual visit and also it could be great to establish that baseline now so that hopefully we can establish a relationship when you can come back and we can see how those things change over time."
"28","  Alright, does that sound like an okay plan like we’ll do the COVID test, we’ll do some blood work and then like I said we can set you up to send you those results or call you however you prefer to communicate as you’re going to assume.  So, we can deal in a lot of ways to communicate now so whatever your preference is and I can send it to the lab for that and like I said we will call you with those results or email you know if you want us at that way."
"29","  Yeah, and those COVID results should be back within 24 hours to you, so."
"30","  No, not anymore.  Well, like a rapid test and then a confirmatory just to double-check."
"31","  Alright, well, it’s great to meet you.  Is there anything else I can help with today?"
"32","  Yeah, it’s like sounds it’s lower my suspicions, but I still would love to check if you’re willing and you know just kind of ________________."
"33","  Thank you so much, Tom and we will see you later."
"34","  Yeah, bye, bye."
