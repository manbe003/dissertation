"1","  Hello."
"2","  Oh, hopefully, you can tell me."
"3","  Okay."
"4","  Yes, yes.  I was due to be coming in every four months or so, but I guess it's been about a year now."
"5","  Yeah, yeah.  Really felt, my number is climbing up.  My sugars are moving up a little bit.  It has got me worried."
"6","  Well, from time to time."
"7","  Well, new, you know, this Covid thing is happened."
"8","  Well, it has been so much stressful.  I am just so tired all the time."
"9","  Well, I just, you know, things stack up at work.  And well, my wife looks after the grandkids after school and they want to play and roll around the floor.  I, I just do not have the energy."
"10","  Yes."
"11","  Well, gosh, it seems like it's been last month or so."
"12","  Well, you know, I am peeing all the time."
"13","  Well, other than my sugars seem to be on the rise, that is about it, I guess."
"14","  Well, they have been rolling around up 200s."
"15","  Well, that seemed to have been gradual."
"16","  Well, most of the time."
"17","  Well, I try everyday.  But you know, I forget now and then."
"18","  Yeah.  Well, that metformin, you know, and what is it? glipizide?"
"19","  It is."
"20","  Yes, yes."
"21","  Yes.  I forget occasionally, you know, once every couple of weeks or twice every couple of weeks."
"22","  No, no."
"23","  Hmm. No."
"24","  Hmm, no."
"25","  No coughs, I do not have."
"26","  No."
"27","  Well, I like to take a little long walk, but I am just not up to it lately."
"28","  Yes.  All of the above."
"29","  Hmm, I have not noticed any fever."
"30","  No, no."
"31","  No."
"32","  No, no, not at all."
"33","  Well, you know, I don't know, I guess, I guess"
"34","  Oh, well, I see."
"35","  Well, I am just concerned about the sugars and getting them under control."
"36","   Well, if you, if you think that is the best place to start."
"37","  Well, I have tried to do it a couple of times a week at least."
"38","  Well."
"39"," I suppose."
"40","  I see."
"41","  Well, I guess I can figure it out.  I have a log but I did not bring it with me today."
"42","  Hmm, hmm."
"43","  Oh, I guess so."
"44","  Well, I sleep pretty good most of the time except for getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night."
"45","  Oh, sometimes as many as two or three."
"46","  No, no."
"47","  Oh, no."
"48","  No, no pain."
"49","  Just peeing all the time."
"50","  Oh, oh."
"51","  Okay."
"52","  Well, Mrs. says I snore a little bit from time to time, yes and sleeps in the same bed for heaven sakes."
"53","  Hmm, no, no she hasnâ€™t said that."
"54","  No, just wake up tired."
"55","  Oh."
"56","  I imagine she would."
"57","  Oh."
"58","  That is something to think about."
"59","  Yeah, I have been feeling a little weak lately."
"60","  Yeah, I feel like my legs are going to give out."
"61","  Yes."
"62","  Brand new."
"63","  Hmm, no, no."
"64","  No."
"65","  Oh, no, none of that."
"66","  No, no, that sounds like a reasonable plan."
"67","  Well, I guess so."
"68","  You are welcome."
"69","  Thank you. Likewise."
