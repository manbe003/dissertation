"1","  Hello Freddie.  Hi Freddie, I’m having a hard time hearing you.  Oh you are muted, so sorry about that Freddie.  Yeah I am not hearing you.  I see that you are muted on my end.  Is there on your computer, can you put your mouse?  Hello?  I think you are unmuted now."
"2","  Freddie?  Yeah, I can hear you."
"3","  Hello, can you hear me?"
"4","  Okay, well give me one second.  Hello now, is that better Freddie?"
"5","  Yeah, great.  Sorry about that.  My name is Nancy.  I am the healthcare worker you are going to be seeing today.  What brings you to this visit?"
"6","  Okay."
"7","  Don’t worry about it.  I’m sorry you had some problems and I’m glad that you are here now.  I just want to make sure I know, we can totally talk about your diabetes numbers, but I also want to make sure, is there anything else you want to talk about today?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Great.  I just saw a note that you are feeling a little tired when you are standing, is that, that is what is stated in the chart, is that accurate?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  You said you are worried?  Is that what you said?"
"12","  Yeah, I think, I definitely want to talk about that too.  So if it is okay, Freddie, I think diabetes numbers, I care about them, but they are not the most important thing to me, I want to make sure you are doing okay overall.  And is it okay if we start by talking about this fatigue you have?  Is that okay?"
"13","  Yeah.  So how long has that been going on for?"
"14","  Okay."
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Okay.  Can I ask how old your grandkids are?"
"17","  Oh, you have got a whole gang there and you are feeling like you cannot keep up with them when you come home?"
"18","  Yeah, okay.  Sounds like… and how long did they, do they live with you full time?"
"19","  Yeah, which, that sounds fantastic for your children to have you there and your grandchildren, but also that can be, 8, 5, and 2, that can be a lot, that can be a handful."
"20","  Yeah, but even for a drop off situation that can be a lot.  And I just, following up on how long has this been going on for?  Have you noticed it in the past like couple of weeks, couple of months?"
"21","  Months? Okay.  Do you, sorry I miss, I write notes so which is where I am looking as I’m talking to you.  Any recent like weight loss, unintentional weight loss?  Okay, just a bunch, any recent like changes and like feeling like you are really constipated, having a lot of diarrhea or anything like that?"
"22","  Okay.  Just making sure I’m not missing anything."
"23","  And then when you sleep, do people tell you that you snore, maybe your wife tells you that you snore really loudly?"
"24","  Okay.  Do you find yourself like dosing off in the middle of the day, anything like that?"
"25","  Yeah, yeah, that is really."
"26","  Oh lot of things can contribute to fatigue and waking up three to four times in the night can totally contribute to fatigue.  Do you, can I, I asked are you having any like stopping in your urination stream, do you feel like you can, when you go to urinate you can empty your bladder all the way?"
"27","  You can?  I guess what I am asking is some men tell me when they are older, especially if men are over 50 that they have some problems with their prostate, does that, have you wondered about that at all?"
"28","  Okay."
"29","  Okay.  So just to make sure I heard you correctly, are you waking up three to four times in the middle of the night because you have to use the restroom or because of something else?"
"30","  To pee, okay.  That is one of the signs of somebody, as men get older their prostates can get bigger and just make it so that it is harder for their bladder to totally empty."
"31","  Right."
"32","  It happens again.  That can be so frustrating."
"33","  Okay.  I know Freddie I’m kind of seeming like I’m all over the map, but I feel like we have talked about maybe there is an element of your waking up a lot frequently in the night and that has maybe helped contributing to the fatigue.  I want to ask a couple of other questions about just like why you’re feeling like you feel, kind of like down at all, like as far as your mood is concerned?"
"34","  Yeah.  I have a lot of patients who maybe describe to me feeling tired or maybe just sad or maybe that they are not really enjoying things that they used to enjoy, and that is totally normal.  I am never going to just say that something that you're feeling is like in your head or anything like that.  I’m just trying to make sure that when I think about fatigue you are hitting like all of the possible contributing factors, if that makes sense.  Yeah.  Okay, so Freddie, we have talked about, sounds like you are getting up a lot to, in the middle of the night to go pee, it feels like you are able to empty your bladder.  I want to ask, would you be interested in starting a medication to maybe help with that?"
"35","  That is totally okay too.  That is why I asked if you are interested."
"36","  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me.  I mean I talk to patients who are kind of have similar at least like specifically like patterns of getting up in the middle of the night and they make decisions to have medications and some do not and they are both very reasonable decisions and I am kind of just asking you about it.  One other thing that I was asking you about is, if you snore a lot and it does not sound like that is contributing at all.  It sounds like, from a mood perspective you are feeling just kind of a little sadness about where you are at, but not like it maybe, not that it is necessarily contributing to the way, to your fatigue overall.  Is that accurate?"
"37","  Okay.  So those are, I wish I had an easy solution to be like here is the fix to the way you are feeling.  I do not, I am wondering, is there anything you are wondering about that could be, that you are wanting to discuss which relates to your fatigue?"
"38","  Yeah, let us talk about your numbers.  That is exactly where I was going to go next."
"39","  Okay."
"40","  I think you have the Olympics that the proverbial Olympics living at your house or at your house after drop, being dropped off at your house."
"41","  Yeah…Freddie, I do not see you as a cranky old man, nor do I see you as someone who is stupid.  I want you to hear that loud and clear from me."
"42","  Yeah.  Freddie, yeah, I only just met you and I hear a couple of things going on.  I hear that you really want to stay healthy, because and like, and have a quality of life that works for you, which is doing, you know, working and taking care of your grandkids and that you are also not really that interested in doing drastic things to your diet and you are not super enthusiastic about the idea of insulin.  Does that kind of sound accurate?"
"43","  Can I just ask you, I just want to get some idea of, I want you to hear me say all those things are very reasonable and I wanted to just kind of get a sense of where we are now and what you have been doing now.  And I am, and then we can think about like where we are going to go next.  I think probably just to give you a heads up, I think where we are going next is I think, I definitely would like to do some, a urine test just to see how your kidneys are working, because kidneys can be affected by diabetes, just to do a check.  And they also do want to do a blood draw just to see where your A1c is.  But I want you to know that I am not going to panic email you a whole list of instructions without talking about whether or not that is going to work for you, because ultimately the way you have to have a plan to manage your diabetes that works with what you want and your limits in your diet.  Does that sound fair?"
"44","  Great.  Can I just start by asking what medications you have at home for your diabetes right now?"
"45","  Right.  And then a lot of my patients miss their medications, would you say you missed your meds like four to five times a week, you know, three to four times a week, one to two?"
"46","  Okay, every other week you miss one dose or every other week you do not take it?"
"47","  Okay, great.  I never assume, I never judge.  So, and then any side effects that have been bothering you about those medications?"
"48","  Okay."
"49","  Okay and then you said you are checking your sugars at home, what is the, how often have you been checking them?"
"50","  Okay and then what is the range you have seen?"
"51","  Okay and then are they, like do you take them, do you take that blood sugar like right when you wake up, after a meal?"
"52","  Perfect, okay.  So yeah, that is definitely a little higher than we normally like to see, but I think what the, as long as it sounds good to you I think the next step is to have you come in for the lab work, the urine tests and then the blood test.  I think what will be also really helpful is if you have a log of your blood sugars, just no need to check that extra, just bring it in so we can see what is happening.  And I want you to know that we actually have a lot of room to try different medications by mouth, so not insulin, and that we can kind of try to see what would work for you.  I will let you know that sometimes we run into insurance issues and I will make sure that whatever plan we work also works with your insurance.  And then Freddie, the last thing I wanted to ask you about is unrelated, but have you ever had a colonoscopy?"
"53","  Okay.  I would really recommend we do some form of screening for colon cancer.  It is what is recommended based on your age.  Have you ever thought about, have you heard about anything for colon cancer, like colonoscopy, fecal tests, or anything like that, have you heard about anything like that?"
"54","  Yeah, would you be interested in something like that?"
"55","  Okay.  And then just so you are aware, I think that is a great route.  It is something we have to do every year, but and if it comes back positive, but does mean that our next step would be recommended to have a colonoscopy, but I think it is starting with the stool samples are really good, so if we are stepping up put that order in as well."
"56","  Freddie, it is great to meet you.  I know we have talked about a lot of different things and really the next step will be just to get, I will put in the order for the stool samples to screen out for colon cancer, and then I also will put the lab work into that.  And the next time you can come in, we can talk about possible ways to change your medication around."
"57","  Yeah, thanks for your time.  Yeah, it was great to meet you and I look forward to seeing you in person."
"58","  All right, take care."
