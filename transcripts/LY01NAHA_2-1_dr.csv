"1","  Hey, good morning.  Oops, I think you are muted.  Can’t hear you.  It is showing me your little red like microphone with a slash through it, so I think that your computer microphone is muted.  Hi there, I think we're here."
"2","  Fantastic, good morning."
"3","  I am guessing that you are Mr. Jones.  What would you like to go by?"
"4","  Pleasure to meet you.  My name is Katherine Dyer.  I am a medical student at the University of Washington and I hear you are here for a diabetes checkup.  Is that right?"
"5","  Fantastic.  Well, how are you doing first of all?"
"6","  Yeah.  Tell me more about that."
"7","  Yeah.  Well that is too good, that sounds like it’s not making you happy, and I am guessing that they miss being able to play with you too."
"8","  Yeah."
"9","  Absolutely.  Well, you know, it’s your health and your body and I feel like my job is to work with you to figure out the best options to get you where you need to go.  So, how long have you been feeling really tired and kind of just like you can’t keep up?"
"10","  Yes, just kind of that insidious creeping like, you do not really notice it until you turn around and suddenly you are exhausted."
"11","  No, 60 is not old."
"12","  Yes, absolutely.  Let me kind of figure out, let me ask you some questions to kind of nail down what exactly has been happening.  When you are really tired, does it feel like you are just, you have no energy, you are feeling just unhappy?"
"13","  Do you get short of breath?"
"14","  Okay.  Do you feel dizzy?"
"15","  If I were to just ask you to describe how you were feeling like two years ago, like how active do you feel like you could be, like what could you do?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Yeah, that sounds fun.  What about like going for a walk, two years ago what kind of walk might they have been able to get you to do with them?"
"18","  Yeah, absolutely."
"19","  Yeah."
"20","  And you are at right now, once or twice a week are you able to walk around the block?"
"21","  Okay.  And at the end of that walk around the block what do you feel like?"
"22","  Yeah."
"23","  Yeah, absolutely.  The best exercise I think is one that makes you happy and it certainly does not have to be walking.  I am more just wondering about, do you feel like now compared to like a couple years ago the amount of exercise you can do is less?"
"24","  Yeah, okay.  And so you mentioned that you had been like playing cards, getting down on the floor with your grandkids previously.  Do you feel like now if you, let us say that you are really trying to summon as much enthusiasm as you could, would you be able to get down on the floor and play a game with them or would it become a struggle?"
"25","  Okay, fair enough."
"26","  Yeah."
"27","  Yeah.  That sounds like it is…"
"28","  Yeah, it sounds to me like you are not being able to get the kind of pleasure from things you really enjoyed that you were able to before."
"29","  And it definitely sounds like you are exhausted.  How is your sleep?"
"30","  Yeah.  You are just kind of falling off there."
"31","  Okay.  So you said you are sleeping okay.  What’s okay mean?"
"32","  Yeah, and when you are waking up do you feel well rested?"
"33","  Yeah."
"34","  Yeah, easing into your day."
"35","  Okay.  Here is a question for you.  Do you snore?"
"36","  Okay, good.  It is always something we want to make sure we are not missing, especially in folks around your age, but so glad that you are very aware of that."
"37","  So, sounds like sleep is really okay.  How about your appetite?"
"38","  Beg your pardon, you kind of cut out ___?"
"39","  Okay, do you feel like you are just kind of eating the same things because it’s your routine?  I mean, are you enjoying your food?"
"40","  Okay.  Do you feel like your appetite has changed in the last year or so?"
"41","  Okay.  All right, so I know that you have a lot of people hounding you about your diet and that is not what I am here to do.  But it is helpful for me to know kind of what you eat.  So what does your daily routine look like?"
"42","  Making me hungry.  What about lunch?"
"43","  What about dinner?"
"44","  Traditionalist?"
"45","  Now who is cooking, are you the chef or is it your wife?"
"46","  Got you, lucky, she could cook."
"47","  Oh, sure.  I mean, who would not.  All right.  Okay, so she is taking care of the cooking for you?"
"48","  Yes, sure."
"49","  Yes.  Okay.  And you mentioned that walking that is not really your thing.  Is there anything that you like to do if it kind of gets you moving your body?"
"50","  That’s very fair.  What if you weren’t tired?"
"51","  But what if you weren’t tired?  If you had a day off, nothing to do and you did not feel tired, what would you do?"
"52","  Okay."
"53","  Okay, so you are a movie buff?  Good to know."
"54","  Yeah."
"55","  Sure.  A couple of questions for you just about your medical history, I saw that you have got diabetes and then I saw that you had high cholesterol in the past and high blood pressure.  Have you ever taken any medications for those?"
"56","  Got you.  And how often would you say that you miss a dose of the metformin or the glipizide?"
"57","  Okay.  And any other health problems that you have?"
"58","  All right, so you are peeing more frequently, but not to the point where it is bothering you or is it?"
"59","  Okay.  And what do you do for work Freddie?"
"60","  Oh, yes, yes, yes, that is a beautiful facility."
"61","  That is very fancy."
"62","  Yeah."
"63","  Yes, it is a very beautiful place, it is very fancy and always makes me feel not like fancy enough when I go see somebody there, I go that are, yes on my best behavior."
"64","  Yes, no, that is, you know what, we could spend a lot of time talking about how undervalued long-term care is in this country, but I think I would be preaching to the choir, wouldn’t I?"
"65","  Okay, so you are still working.  What do you do when at work?"
"66","  Okay, so you are, that’s a busy job.  You are doing a lot, keeping moving at work."
"67","  Yes, it is a very important job.  They have got to keep you going.  Those people need you."
"68","  Yes."
"69","  Absolutely.  All right.  We just need to increase the pool, increase the reserves, so you can give this much and have this much leftover instead of giving them this much.  Is that it?"
"70","  Yeah."
"71","  Yeah, it is, a lot of people are pretty scared of that.  I mean, it seems like a big step, right?"
"72","  Yes."
"73","  I did a little look-in in your chart, and I was looking at your A1c which that is the measure of how your blood glucose, your blood sugar has been kind of performing for a three-month chunks at a time.  The last time that I saw that we checked that was in 2021.  So I think you are due, I think that we should get an idea of what that is looking like today."
"74","  I also saw that it has been kind of going up for the last couple years, it was 6.9 back in March 2019 and the last one was 7.9.  So that means that you are just kind of resting blood sugar has been kind of moving up.  What do you think has changed over those couple of years?"
"75","  Okay.  Let me check."
"76","  Got you."
"77","  Got you.  Yes, what I am seeing…"
"78","  Yeah, well that’s an important thing that for us to clarify."
"79","  No, absolutely.  I mean, I am seeing this and getting to meet you for the first time and you have been dealing with this for a plenty of time.  So I can see you are the subject matter expert, but I also want to make sure that we are working with the same info.  So the thing that I am seeing in the chart was 6.9 back in March of 2019, and 7.4 in August of 2019, then 7.6 in February 2020 and then 7.9 in March of 2021.  So that’s what it’s showing me in the computer, but if it sounds like it’s different for you, then we can check your records and make sure that we have the right info, but either way I think we should see what it’s doing right now, so we get a better picture."
"80","  But what do you think is different between now and like March of 2019?  Is there anything that you think you are doing different or anything that has kind of changed in your life?"
"81","  Okay."
"82","  Yes."
"83","  Okay…"
"84","  Yes."
"85","  Yes, it did, absolutely."
"86","  Well, you know, that is a difficult one.  I have not met anyone who has successfully managed that one from increasing.  So if you figure out how, you let me know okay?  I could make some people very happy.  Okay, so nothing really changing for you as far as your diet, as far as your activity, you are still, you know going to work, but lately you have just been feeling really exhausted."
"87","  Yeah."
"88","  Oh, I can see the enthusiasm in your face, it is just palpable."
"89","  I know, it takes the joy out of it though does it not?"
"90","  Yeah."
"91","  Yes.  Okay.  I think it is something we should check for sure.  As far as the things that can kind of make your blood sugar increase, I mean you know, we have definitely told you and you know sure it is diet, it is exercise and obviously we have already got you on some medications here.  Before we talk about starting insulin, I want to see where you are at right?  As far as the diet piece is concerned, I am not going to lecture you about what I think you should be eating, but one thing I want you to think about, I didn’t hear a lot from you about vegetables and kind of green leafy things, things with a lot of fiber.  Do you think you would be able to add some of that to what you have been eating?"
"92","  Okay, it is a start.  It can be; it does not have to be bad.  It does not have to be you know just plain salad.  But if you are able to work in some more of those kind of vegetables, those things can kind of help bring your blood sugar down a little bit, because you know those, especially starchy stuff, breaded stuff, when you eat it, it makes your blood sugar go way up and then your body has to kind of bring it back down.  But if you have things that are called like lower glycemic index foods, it just means that when you eat them it does not go up like so much.  That can help.  And things with fiber in them are something that could be helpful.  So not taking away…"
"93","  They do, but there are things that have some fiber in them like bread, and like a whole wheat bread has more fiber than like a white bread, right? "
"94","  So of the whole wheat will make your blood sugar go up less than the white, but even with like your steak and potato, can we add some broccoli or some cauliflower or something like that?"
"95","  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, it sounds like she is an excellent cook, so I am sure she will be more than up to the challenge of making that taste good.  So, can we think about it?  Can I put a pin in it?"
"96","  Okay.  I mean, I know, she is the boss, so I will let you be the middle man okay?"
"97","  Okay, and then the other things I want to think about are just different reasons why you can feel tired.  So I know you said you do not feel like you are having apnea and waking up in the nights.  Not everybody knows, so I want to you to like ask the boss if you snore or if she has ever noticed that you kind of stop breathing at night, because we do not know that we snore and if that…"
"98","  Okay."
"99","  Okay."
"100","  All right.  Other thing I would like to check, one of the other things that can make you feel just exhausted and tired is if you are anemic, if you don’t have enough good red blood cells running around to transport oxygen where it needs to be.  I think we should check and it is just a blood test, because if you are having that problem, I mean, you just feel exhausted all the time.  Even if you get good rest you just do not have a lot of get up and go and I think that would be worth checking.  I would like to check your thyroid too.  That is another thing that can just make you feel really blocked, like it can make you feel not because you have depression, but because of the way the hormones are, it can make you feel just like exhausted and fatigued and no energy and nothing is fine, just feeling crummy and it can also cause you to gain weight and mess with your blood sugar.  So I think that is something we should check too, because if, you know if that is going on and you know we are trying to address all the kind of downstream stuff, it’s not going to work as well if we are not addressing the problem.  So…"
"101","  I also want to check your cholesterol.  Well, if we are stealing your blood anyway, we might as well do it right and see where that is at."
"102","  Yeah."
"103","  Yes.  I think that’s something we want to check because if that’s high, you know that is something that could be really important to address to prevent bad things from happening down the road, you know things like heart attacks and strokes and all that kind of stuff.  We do not want to deal with that.  You are far, you are too young.  You have grandkids to take care of.  So thinking about that kind of preventative sort of care, I think that is something we should check while we are doing that.  Okay?  So I want to steal your blood.  I want you to think about those vegetables.  And then the other thing that I noticed here is that you have not had any kind of screening for colon cancer which is something that we recommend for folks your age, just to make sure we are not missing anything.  So there are a few ways we can do that.  And we think from a yearly test where we send you a little card and you put a little bit of poop on it and you send it in and they just look to see if there are any cells in there that were kind of funky and you do that every year, all the way up to like a colonoscopy, you know, where you drink a bunch of stuff, you get really acquainted with your own bathroom and then they you know put you to sleep and take a look at your whole colon.  The next thing about that is it lasts 10 years.  So where do you -- do you feel like either of those options are somewhere in between might be something you would be up for? "
"104","  Yes.  I think that would be a great thing too, because you know I mean there is more than one reason why you could have a little bit of blood in your stool, and it might be you know not even something you would have noticed right, because I am guessing you would probably notice if your toilet were full of blood or full of black stuff.  Right? But if there can be a little bit and if you are having those little things, it can be even from something like diverticulitis, or even some punctures in your colon or anything like that that can be a reason why you could be anemic.  Right? So just telling a little bit of oozing.  So I think we should check on that."
"105","  Okay.  And then I am going to want to have you come visit me again, so we can go over the results of all the stuff all right?"
"106","  Yeah, and then we can see kind of where you are at and we can make a good plan for addressing your diabetes where it is and then also working on kind of this more preventative stuff to make sure that we are not missing anything and that we are heading off stuff that we might really not want to deal with in the future.  Does that sound like a good plan for you?"
"107","  And while I am thinking about it, just a couple more questions before I let you get back to your day.  Any changes in your vision?"
"108","  Any numbness or tingling in your hands and feet?"
"109","  Yeah."
"110","  Good.  Definitely something to keep an eye on.  And if we are able to, when you come back if we can make it an in-person visit, we do like to just test your feet every year just to make sure we are monitoring that.  I know with you know COVID and with busy lives it is sometimes telephone or video is a good option.  So next time you see me in person, I think we should do that."
"111","  And you mentioned that you are peeing a lot, but any burning?"
"112","  Any blood?"
"113","  Any blood anywhere?"
"114","  Good, okay.  Some of the things that we think about with diabetes, just making sure you are not getting that numbness and tingling, making sure your vision is not changing, making sure your kidneys are doing good.  Then I am going to give you one more piece of homework and that is just to get your diabetic vision screening.  Do you think you could do that before the next time that we see each other?"
"115","  I will send you a referral.  Do you have MyChart?  Do you get the little notifications?"
"116","  Okay perfect.  I will put the information in there.  We can send a referral over to them and have them give you a call."
"117","  Okay.  So I am giving you homework and then we are going to check some labs and I am going to do some work on my end, and then you and I are going to get together, see how it went and talk about kind of where we are at and next steps.  Does that sound like a good plan? "
"118","  Excellent.  What questions do you have for me?"
"119","  Good deal.  Well, Freddie, it has been such a pleasure talking to you, thank you for coming to visit me today."
"120","  Enjoy the rest of your day."
