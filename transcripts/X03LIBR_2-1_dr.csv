"1","  Hello! Can you hear me?  Oh, I am having trouble hearing you.  It looks like you’re on mute.  I can’t hear you too well.  It has a mute sign right there next to your name, I don’t know if you can, if you see that microphone on your computer screen on this.  There you go, I can hear you now."
"2","  Yeah, can you hear me?"
"3","  All right.  My name is Fabio.  I am a first-year medical student at the University of Washington.  I’ll be talking to you today.  Can you verify your name and date of birth?"
"4","  Okay.  Everything that we talk about today Tom will be kept confidential and just between me and the attending physician.  All right.  Can you tell me a little bit about what’s going on today?"
"5","  When did the cold start?"
"6","  And what are you, can you tell me more about what you’re feeling specifically?"
"7","  Okay, any difficulty breathing?"
"8","  Okay.  Do you have, do you feel like you are short of breath when you get up and walk around?"
"9","  Okay, I apologize Tom.  How about fever or any chills?"
"10","  And how about any chills?"
"11","  All right.  So, I have here that you feel, you have been feeling a little bit under the weather in the past couple of days.  You have a wet cough with clearish whitish phlegm and you are running a little warm but you haven’t really checked the temperature yet, correct? Okay.  Any, have you tried anything to alleviate what you’re feeling?"
"12","  How well did it go?"
"13","  Anything that’s making it worse specifically your symptoms?"
"14","  And you mentioned that your girlfriend is the one that wanted you to come in today, correct?"
"15","  All right, what is she specifically worried about?"
"16","  May I ask you if you’ve been tested again for COVID with one of those at-home tests?"
"17","  And have you been vaccinated against the COVID?"
"18","  All right.  Now, I am going to ask you some questions that we ask every single patient just to get you solidified in our database here, any medical history?"
"19","  Like high blood pressure, high cholesterol anything like that?"
"20","  Okay, so no medical problems, that’s good news there.  Any surgeries in the past?"
"21","  Diarrhea sometimes, okay, but nothing like diagnosed high blood pressure or high cholesterol or anything like that?  Is your diarrhea worsening right now that you’re sick or is it kind of the same as before?"
"22","  Okay, any surgeries in the past?"
"23","  Okay.  Are you currently on any medications?"
"24","  Any allergies to any medications?"
"25","  Any tobacco or alcohol usage?"
"26","  How about any recreational drug use?"
"27","  Okay and other than the COVID vaccine, are you up to date with your other immunizations?"
"28","  All right.  Do you think I have all the questions here?  So, what your, the people around you seemed to be worried about the most is that you’re getting sick here for the last couple of days.  I think since you don’t have any medical history and you don’t?"
"29","  When your girlfriend is worried about that, sorry."
"30","  Okay, I apologize."
"31","  Okay, I apologize, Tom.  I meant just your girlfriend what she is worried about is that you have been sick for the past couple of days?"
"32","  All right.  Is that something that you would be willing to do the COVID test or?"
"33","  Okay.  So, I can send it in for you to get a COVID test at the nearest testing center and just write a prescription for that but I feel like treatment-wise if you do have COVID or if you do have the flu, it is just resting and any sore throat symptoms?"
"34","  Okay.  You’re really healthy individual, you have no medical history right now.  You know COVID is very serious and the flu is very serious.  So, it is something just to be worried about and just to get tested for it and if it is positive, you can just take the correct protocol and get better."
"35","  All right.  Let me see what else."
"36","  Other than your main complaint with today was COVID and the symptoms that you’re feeling and you have no shortness of breath and you have no difficulty breathing.  So, I am not too worried about those symptoms getting worse but if you know they do, we’re here and we can talk some more and if there is anything else that your girlfriend could possibly add to this conversation, I would love to hear it as well."
"37","  Okay, all right.  Can I ask you just a couple of more questions, Tom or are you sure?"
"38","  What you currently do for work?"
"39","  Construction.  How long have you been doing that for?"
"40","  Okay.  Do you particularly like your job, construction or?"
"41","  It’s okay.  Yeah, one of my good friends here in Idaho, he is doing construction as well and it’s just crazy busy and he really likes it.  So, it’s a place to be for him."
"42","  Okay.  Do you feel like you have any, if I may ask, does your construction job offer insurance to you?"
"43","  Blue Cross, okay and do you feel like doing any financial hardships?"
"44","  Sorry, what was that, you kind of broke out here?"
"45","  I am sorry, Tom, I didn’t hear it again."
"46","  Okay, I am sorry some of these telehealth absolutely hard to talk to back and forth."
"47","  Okay, all right, Tom.  Is there any other questions do you specifically have for me?  I think what you are doing is perfectly fine.  When you do have those symptoms take Tylenol and ibuprofen and I can send it in for you to get COVID tested if that’s something you’re comfortable with."
"48","  Okay.  So, I’ll send that in whenever you have time just go to the nearest testing center there and get started."
"49","  All right.  Any other questions for me I am sorry if this is."
"50","  All right.  I am sorry if this is annoying or difficult conversation to have, but you know we’re here to help and if you need us again we’re here."
"51","  Okay, thank you, Tom.  I think you're all good to leave."
