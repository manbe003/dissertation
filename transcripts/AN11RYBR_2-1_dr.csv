"1","  Hello. I think you’re mute.  I can’t hear you right now.  I can’t hear you.  Can you hear me.  I think you’re mute now."
"2","  Oh okay, okay, hi, Tom, how you are doing today?"
"3","  Okay, well, I am glad you came in today.  My name is Enis Marshall.  I am just going to be talking to you little bit about why you came in and hopefully we could help you feel better. So, I see that you have a concern for COVID as well as wanting to have general check in.  So, let’s start with the COVID.  Have you had any recent exposures that you know of?"
"4","  Okay, okay but I just, if you had not know, it’s kind of a good ___, but still that’s okay.  Can you tell me a little bit more about what you have been experiencing?"
"5","  So, you said you have a productive cough as well as like a low-grade fever right now."
"6","  Okay.  Are you taking anything to make you feel better?"
"7","  Okay and does that help at all?"
"8","  Okay, good to know.  How often do you think you’re taking it?"
"9","  Okay, okay and so with your COVID symptoms or possible symptoms of COVID, but we’ll see what they are about when did they start?"
"10","  Last week, okay and have they gotten worse, or if anything, have they changed?"
"11","  Yeah, okay.  So, it’s been going on for about a week and hasn’t changed much except for like with DayQuil will sometimes suppressing the symptoms and I guess I just want to ask about a few more symptoms that you might be having.  Do you have any runny nose?"
"12","  Okay, no runny nose and any headache at all?"
"13","  Okay, you already mentioned a productive cough and have you had, you said you mentioned you had some changes in your sleep, okay, I think that it’s always hard to differentiate between what’s regular cold and COVID, so I think fourth day would be important to get a COVID test again.  Have you tried to take one at home already?"
"14","  You have."
"15","  You have not, okay.  Yeah, so if you’re okay with that I think we should get that done today so we can determine if it is COVID or not since your symptoms, have you been staying home or going out, and if so, wearing your mask, what have you been doing?"
"16","  Okay."
"17","  Yeah, I hear that, okay, okay.  Well, do you have any other concerns about possibly having COVID or anything else that you want to talk about before we move on to your general check in."
"18","  Okay, okay.  So, we’ll get to that, we’ll order that PCR lab for your COVID, possible COVID.  As far as your general check in, is there anything that’s concerning you right now beyond COVID."
"19","  Okay, how would you describe like some of your exercise habits?"
"20","  And when you working out, do you ever have any trouble working out, any like fatigue with that or any shortness of breath?"
"21","  Okay, well that’s good and it’s good to get that exercise in.  As far as like your diet, how is that going like how would you describe your diet?"
"22","  And what you by consistent, can you tell me a little bit more like are you fruits and veg, including fruits and veggies, heavy on protein, how would you describe it."
"23","  Okay."
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Well, it’s definitely important to get some protein but you definitely want to kind of watch the levels that you’re getting and especially as you age little bit like being conscious at like making sure that you’re getting more of your fruit groups, especially like your veggies and like getting fiber in, are you open to kind of like adjusting your diet so that you can include some of those things?"
"26","  Okay, okay, well maybe start thinking about it and we can definitely revisit it if that’s something you want to do, but I think that would be important to start thinking about, how do you feel about that, okay. Well, we can talk more about that as far as like your vision, any changes in vision?"
"27","  Okay, any changes in you already mentioned when you exercise that you don’t have any shortness of breath, any changes in your breathing or any chest pains ever?"
"28","  Okay, any pain or changes in your joints or?"
"29","  No, okay and let’s see any changes in like in your appetite as far as like eating more or eating less?"
"30","  Okay, any concerns with weight either gaining or losing?"
"31","  Okay.  So, so far sounds like you’re doing pretty well, that’s great.  I guess any changes in your skin at all like as far as any noticeable moles or any rashes or anything like that?"
"32","  Okay, well I think it’s definitely great that we’re talking about this.  I think at some point if you do have the ability to come in, I think it would be good to listen, coming in and listen to your heart and listen to your lungs and do kind of like a head to toe exam.  I think this is a great start talking about it on telehealth, but if you have the ability, I think that would be great to schedule.  What are your thoughts on that?"
"33","  Okay, that would be great.  So, do you have any other questions for me today?"
"34","  Okay, well if no other questions, I think we want to order that PCR COVID test and we can figure out where is the best place for you to go get that done so you can have that and then we can, if you want we can call and give you the results, or it can be assessable on your chart if you have access to that, do you have any preference."
"35","  Okay, well we can just put in your chart, and if you can call us if you have any questions about it, but if nothing else, thank you for coming in today."
"36","  Thank you.  It was been wonderful talking to you and we’ll try to schedule that physical exam if you are open to it."
"37","  All right.  Have a good one."
