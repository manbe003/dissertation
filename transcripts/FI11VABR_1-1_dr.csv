"1","  Hi, Mr. Johnson, how are you?"
"2","  Great.  My name is Ayana.  I am a first-year medical student working in the _____ region at the University of Washington, here to just kind of ask you a couple of questions.  Can I get a feel as to what brings you in today and then we can go from there?"
"3","  Alright.  Before we start, do you have any questions for me?"
"4","  You don’t, okay.  Alright, so could you tell me a little bit about how all of this began, how you are feeling right now?"
"5","  Gotcha.  So, cold for about a week.  Did you wake up with it one day?  Did it come like midday, early morning?"
"6","  Okay, so a week ago from today you woke up with it and what symptoms were you having, was it waking up with a sore throat, had fever, anything like that?"
"7","  Okay, okay, and did you notice that this got worse throughout the week?"
"8","  About the same, okay, and then would you say that you can like attribute it to? oh go ahead, go ahead."
"9","  Oh okay.  Would you attribute it to anything?  Would you say that maybe there is like someone you were exposed to or have you just seen anyone or anything like that who has been sick?"
"10","  Okay, and would you say that it’s, on a scale of 1 to 10, like how bad it feels, how would you rate it?"
"11","  An 8, okay.  So, just summarizing a little bit of what you told me so far.  You woke up about a week ago with cough and a little bit of fever and you were encouraged to get a COVID test by your girlfriend.  As of now, it’s about like an 8 or so, not feeling too good."
"12","  Okay.  Alright.  Whose all in your house live with you?"
"13","  Who all lives in your house with you?"
"14","  Okay, awesome and is she feeling alright?"
"15","  Okay.  Alright.  I am just going to go through and ask you kind of a systemic series of questions just to make sure we can find out anything else that may be going on and it’s just kind of include like holistic view of your health and the things that we weigh in when we consider these things.  I am just going to start off with kind of going through your family history, then this will dive into potentially sexual history, health related behaviors and a few other things of which ________ try to practice it."
"16","  Okay.  So, first starting off with your family history.  Have you had anyone in your family have any major illnesses or sicknesses?"
"17","  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I am sorry to hear that.  Anything else related to if you have any siblings or anything like that, aunts, uncles?"
"18","  Okay, okay.  Alright, we then moving ahead to the next section.  This will be more like a social history and I will ask you a series of questions kind of related to that, the first one being what you like to do for work or what you participate in, in your day to day?"
"19","  Oh, that’s awesome, that’s awesome.  Where do you guys go bike ride?"
"20","  Oh, okay, very cool.  That’s awesome.  I wish I got out more, but sometimes the random snow has kept me in.  What else do you like to do for fun aside from bike rides and stuff?"
"21","  It’s awesome.  Like hope you get some now that, I won’t say the pandemic is over, but now that it is cooled down quite a bit.  Hopefully you can get some traveling in as soon as you get feeling better and _____."
"22","  Alright, the next question.  Do you have any sources of support or people that you feel like you could go to if you have something come up?"
"23","  Okay, okay, and do you feel as though you have financial support, whether that’s insurance or work?"
"24","  Okay, good, alright, and then down to it, just a few more things that I would like to cover.  What are your biggest like stressors that you have going on right now?"
"25","  Good, good, I am glad to hear that, and then the last a little bit that I would like to ask people, is there anything that you prefer I know about you, your character, your identity, as we continue talking, whether those be like pronouns or anything like that?  Anything?"
"26","  Okay, okay, alright.  This next section then will be kind of a review of systems, just going through all of your illness and making sure that we can get it filled for every system making sure what’s affected, what’s not, just to be holistically have all of your symptoms together.  Okay, so the first of it being, have you noticed any changes with like fever, chills, shaking, low grade fever, have you noticed like higher/lower, dissipate?"
"27","  Okay, okay.  Any chills that accompanied it?"
"28","  Alright.  Any changes in weight?"
"29","  Have you had any like any changes like with your fingers or hands/skin all around?"
"30","  This next section being, have you had any trouble with vision, sight, anything along those lines?"
"31","  Okay, okay.  Then have you had any trouble with like your face congestion, anything along these areas, puffy sinuses and stuff like that, ear pain?"
"32","  Alright.  Then have you noticed any swollen lymph nodes throughout your body, whether it is in your arm pits or in the neck, clavicle?"
"33","  Alright.  Have you had any stomach related issues?  Any like abdominal pain?"
"34","  Just diarrhea, okay, okay and then, did that come out at the same time or come around about the same time that you noticed yourself getting sick or has it been for a longer period of time?"
"35","  Okay, alright.  How long would you say that you had diarrhea for?"
"36","  Two to three years, okay.  I want to ask you a series of questions following that and then I am going to circle back.  I just want to make a quick note to myself and then we will go through the rest of the review and then we will trace back to that one. Okay."
"37","  Alright.  So, have you noticed any like, weird or unexplained muscle pain or fatigue that has come out of anywhere?"
"38","  Okay, just thought associated with you being sick now.  okay, gotcha.  Right, have you noticed any like neurological changes or trouble like remembering things or people or anything like that?"
"39","  Alright, right.  Then, moving forward with this.  Have you noticed any difficulty urination, any trouble using the bathroom aside from the diarrhea, that you mentioned?"
"40","  Okay.  Alright.  Then the last couple of questions.  Do you have any allergy or medications that you are currently using.  I know you mentioned Dayquil but anything aside from that?"
"41","  Okay, okay.  Alright.  So, circling back to the diarrhea that you mentioned earlier, could you may be described the consistency?"
"42","  Yeah, so there is different types that can be kind of like, diarrhea that is pure liquid, somewhat chunks, maybe it looks red color, that kind of thing?"
"43","  Okay, chunky liquidy, and then would you ever notice any blood that accompanied it too?"
"44","  None.  Alright and it looks like that you are about 58 years old, so maybe you are due for a colonoscopy in about two years.  Have you ever received one or another date _______ received it so?"
"45","  No, okay.  Okay, I am going to swap over to that health-related behavior section, which just kind of helps me get a feel for what types of care you take of yourself and what’s you have to offer to and you are able to take it, manage of, so, just starting off like with a little bit of diet and exercise and then we will migrate a little bit into like, do you have a regular provider and what not to.  So, if you could just describe your diet and exercise, just a kind of generally, that would be great?"
"46","  Okay, gotcha.  Alright, and then how would you, how much would you say you exercise a week, if you got like a couple of hours a day per week or, how is that all look?"
"47","  Okay, gotcha.  So, a little bit around, that’s good.  Do you have a primary care provider that you see regularly?"
"48","  Do you have a dentist by chance?"
"49","  Alright, and then do you wear a seatbelt when you drive?"
"50","  Okay, do you have fire arms within your home?"
"51","  Okay.  I know, the series of questions is extraneous but that just kind of get me better picture of who you are and what happens in your life and what things you need to do and what not to.  Alright.  So, being that you don’t have a primary care provider and you are experiencing bouts of diarrhea as well as the illness that you came presenting with me today, I think there is a couple of things that maybe helpful moving forward, just like some general things being a colonoscopy would be really good to evaluate your system and make sure that everything is okay there.  If you have had diarrhea about once a week for, you said, a couple of years now, it might be good just to make sure that everything is functioning correctly and being that you are 58 you are due for one here soon, so maybe sooner a little bit rather than later.  Does that sound okay as part of your plan?"
"52","  Gotcha."
"53","  Gotcha.  Yeah.  In it, it can be kind of invasive, but there are other types of tests that we could perform that are a little bit less, example, we just need to collect like a stool sample and this can kind of be something that we use to test for potential cancer development and you had mentioned that your mom, excuse me, you have to remind me if it’s your mom or if it was your grandfather who had passed from colon cancer?  Your grandfather?"
"54","  Your grandfather, your mother with breast cancer?"
"55","  Okay.  Just to be safe, I think that it might be safe just to check for things just in case to make sure that they aren’t existing within you.  Would that be more of a suitable test?"
"56","  Okay, okay.  We'll look that and we can sort through that a little bit later and going back to your major aliment that brought you in today, I think that number one would be greatest to get a COVID test.  Preferably a PCR, I think that those tend to be a little bit more sure in answering and what not to.  Is there anything that you need in regard to time off work or anything like that?"
"57","  Hello, can you hear me?"
"58","  No, no worries.  I was just going to say is there anything you need in regard to time off work or anything like that?"
"59","  Have you already had to take time off?  Do you need doctor's note if your work accepts them?"
"60","  Okay, okay, and do they offer like paid leave or something like that or you can just?"
"61","  Good, good.  Alright, and if that helps to, I know, you said you are living with your girlfriend, if she starts to experience any sickness or anything like that too, I could send you home with a take home test for her just in case she starts to develop similar symptoms?"
"62","  Okay.  Alright, and discussing anything else.  Is there anything else today that you want to talk about in terms of care?  I know you just kind of mentioned a little bit about fitting in an appointment in your schedule and even though you don’t have a PCP established and sometimes it can be hassle getting these meetings and you can even regularly try to schedule meetings like this and that could be helpful in the long term for your health in case anything major comes up?"
"63","  Okay, okay.  Well, I can always have them followup with you after the fact and if it really interests you, you can always reach out to me directly and I can provide you my number via the front desk."
"64","  Alright.  Right, any other questions or things that you like to add in?"
"65","  Okay.  Alright, well that sounds good.  Thank you so much for joining me today.  I appreciate it.  I am going to go ahead and allow you to exit this zoom and then hopefully we can get you COVID testing and get you all ______away and if there is required followup then we will handle that accordingly."
"66","  Of course."
