"1","  Hi Tom.  My name is Emma Raizman.  Would you be able to unmute for me Tom, so I can hear you?  I still can’t hear you Tom.  I think it’s in the lower left-hand corner."
"2","  Hi."
"3","  Now I think it turned you really off, there you go."
"4","  Hi Tom.  My name is Emma Raizman.  I am going to be taking care of you today.  How are you doing?"
"5","  Yeh, I am sorry to hear that you are feeling pretty under the weather and can you tell me a little bit more about the symptoms you are experiencing?"
"6","  Okay, well how about you start telling me about what symptoms you are having today?"
"7","  Yeah, it’s hard right now, because the cold and COVID have a lot of overlapping symptoms and so I think it’s good to be evaluated.  So, have you had any measured fever or chills?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay, that’s good to know.  And have you had any loss of taste or smell?"
"10","  Okay.  And have you had any difficulty breathing?"
"11","  Okay, but you have never felt like really short of breath, feeling like you can’t catch any air?"
"12","  No?  Okay.  And is anyone around you sick right now?"
"13","  Okay."
"14","  Okay.  She is also sick right now though?"
"15","  Oh, she is okay.  Okay good to know.  Okay, and did you receive your COVID vaccines?"
"16","  Okay.  What about you?"
"17","  Okay.  Okay that’s good to know.  It’s okay that you have not gotten your vaccines.  I just – that’s just good information for me to know either way, because it helps me determine how higher risk you are for serious infection if you do in fact have COVID.  Since you have been sick, have you taken any COVID tests?"
"18","  Okay.  And what have you been doing to try and help yourself feel better?  Have you found anything that makes you feel better?"
"19","  Okay.  And has there been anything that’s made it worse?"
"20","  Okay."
"21","  And I heard that you said something about work, have you still been able to work even though you have been feeling ill?"
"22","  Yeah.  Is that a stressor for you?"
"23","  Okay, yeah.  Thanks for sharing that information with me.  And I know that we don’t have much of a health history on you Tom, so I was wondering if you know of any chronic conditions that you have such as like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma."
"24","  You can’t think of anything? Okay and do you take any medications regularly?"
"25","  No? Okay.  That’s good to know.  Well, Tom, based on this, I think it’s important that we have you tested for COVID.  That way we can determine if you have it or not, and then from there we can talk about other treatments, but the most important thing is that you get lots of rest and that you are hydrating well and then if you ever feel short of breath, then you go to the ER immediately, but I think it would be good to know if maybe this is just a cold or if this is COVID-19, so I would like to have you get a COVID test.  How do you feel about that?"
"26","  Yeah, I can put an order in and then you can go to the urgent care and you can get a test done there."
"27","  Do you have any, or what concerns do you have?"
"28","  I would like to have you come in for a followup appointment, so we can do like a physical exam and order some bloodwork and all of that since we have not seen you in a while, but I think it would probably be better to wait until you recovered from this before we bring you into the clinic."
"29","  Yeah, you can just come to the clinic to get the test and then in a couple of weeks I would like to schedule an appointment to do a full physical exam."
"30","  Do you have a way to check your blood pressure at home?"
"31","  Okay, that’s okay, that’s just one thing that you could check at home until we have our appointment, but ultimately, I think until you are tested for COVID, I want you to stay hydrated and get lots of rest and you can continue to use the DayQuil and the NyQuil if that’s helpful to you and as long as you are continuing to get better or not get worse, then you are okay to stay home.  But if you have any worsening symptoms, then you should probably go to either the urgent care or the ER to be evaluated further."
"32","  Just because it’s hard with this virtual visit that I can’t listen to your lungs, you know, I can’t check your vitals and make sure you are breathing okay and so you look like you are doing okay.  I know you are sick and you are not feeling well but, overall I am not super, super concerned, but if you do get worse, it’s important that you are evaluated in person."
"33","  And if you don’t get better over the next week then I think it’s also worth you coming in for an appointment so we can explore potential other causes for your illness."
"34","  I know that’s a lot of information."
"35","  Is there -- what can I repeat or clarify for you?"
"36","  Um, I think it is really important that you do get tested for COVID and if you are positive, then it’s important that you quarantine and unfortunately that will mean that you can’t go to work, which I know is a really big stress for you.  But this is really infectious illness and we don’t want to spread it to other people and I also want to make sure that you have the opportunity to rest and so I don’t really know what it is.  It might be COVID-19, it might be a cold, but either way, I think it’s definitely worth looking into further."
"37","  Yeah, we will be open until 6 p.m., so you can come in."
"38","  If not, then you could also come in tomorrow after work."
"39","  Okay.  I do -- I am a little concerned about the fact that you are sick and you are still going to work and I know that there is a need to make money, but and I totally understand that.  If possible, I would recommend that you _______ while you are at work until we know if you do have COVID or not and just to keep your other coworkers safe."
"40","  Okay that’s good to know.  Anything else you want to chat about today, Tom?"
"41","  I don’t think so.  I think the rest of the exam we will probably want to do in another week or two.  Once you are feeling better, then we will have you come in for a followup appointment and I will have someone from my office call you to schedule that appointment."
"42","  I know it’s frustrating that there is not as much we can do over, over a Zoom meeting."
"43","  Yeah.  Alright Tom, well, it was great talking to you today.  I am ordering your COVID test, so go ahead and get that tomorrow after work and I will have someone from my office call you to schedule up a followup appointment for a full physical exam."
"44","  Okay, try and get lots of rest and if you feel worse, please go to the ER."
"45","  There should be a leave button in the bottom right hand corner for end the call."
