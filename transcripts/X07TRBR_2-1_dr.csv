"1","  Hi Tom.  I think you're muted.  Do you mind turning your microphone on.  Oh okay, let's see here, so you're looking at the screen right, yeah, okay.  And on the, it's okay, we’ll walk through this together.  So at the bottom left of the screen do you see like a microphone looking symbol?"
"2","  Yes, thank you."
"3","  Yeah, no, you did great.  Nice to meet you, Tom.  I'm Eva.  I'll be conducting our visit today.  Nice to meet you.  How are you doing?"
"4","  Yeah.  Gosh, I'm so sorry that you're not feeling well, but I'm glad that you're here.  Tell me how I can help?"
"5","  Yeah.  Oh, I'm glad you're here and it sounds like your girlfriend cares about you."
"6","  Yeah, what's her name?"
"7","  Emily?"
"8","  Great.  So, yeah, we can certainly talk about both of those things today.  I want to, I want to talk about kind of how you're not feeling well first and we'll just do a general kind of a checkup and see how you're doing.  How does that sound?"
"9","  Okay.  And so tell me about what's been going on lately?"
"10","  Okay.  Tell me more."
"11","  What color it is?"
"12","  Oh yeah.  What color is the stuff that you're bringing up?"
"13","  White you said?"
"14","  Okay.  Other than the cough and not feeling well, what other symptoms?"
"15","  Okay.  Have you taken your temperature?"
"16","  Oh, that's totally okay.  Have you been around anybody who has been having similar symptoms?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yeah, what do you do for your job?"
"19","  Okay.  Okay, and when you are, when you're coughing, is there a specific time of the day?"
"20","  Okay.  Is it worse when you lay down versus when you sit up?"
"21","  Okay.  What about after you've had a large meal?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay.  And have you noticed your heart beating funny?"
"24","  Okay.  Swelling, weird swelling anywhere?"
"25","  Okay.  Do you get night sweats at night?"
"26","  Okay, okay.  And this has only been happening for five days?"
"27","  Okay.  Do you think overall its gotten worse, gotten better?"
"28","  Okay.  Does anything make it worse or better?"
"29","  DayQuil."
"30","  Okay, yeah, that makes sense.  Do you have trouble breathing?"
"31","  And you mentioned, you mentioned that you had taken the COVID test or you would like to take a COVID test?"
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Sounds like she cares."
"34","  Yeah, okay.  Any chest pain?"
"35","  No, okay.  All right.  Do you have allergies?"
"36","  Okay.  Do you smoke?"
"37","  Okay.  You mentioned that you're working construction, have you been around like any new environments or substances?"
"38","  Okay, all right.  What do you think is going on?"
"39","  Yeah.  I would agree with that.  It does sound like it's more viral.  With the symptoms that you are describing to me, I'm less concerned about things like pneumonias or bad heart problems.  So that's reassuring right off the back for me.  I wish that you were here, so I could do a physical exam and, but I think just getting that history makes me more reassured.  I don't think and, I don't think it's anything too scary, so that's really great.  In terms of where do we go from here, I think what you're doing with DayQuil is fine.  I think generally things like this, a viral kind of illness will run its course and it sounds like it's been, it’s been five days, so this, some of this can last up for, you know a week or two and the cough can go on for even longer.  So what I'd like to do is just to follow up and actually let me get your thoughts on what you think of all of this so far?"
"40","  Yeah."
"41","  Would you, would you like to get a COVID test just to know or we don't have to, I think, I think for viruses like this a lot of times it will run its course, it doesn't change much of what we would do, but it is helpful knowledge. "
"42","  Okay.  And you've not gotten the vaccine or have you?"
"43","  Okay."
"44","  Okay.  And is she vaccinated?"
"45","  Oh, she is a teacher, okay."
"46","  Okay and you guys live together?"
"47","  Okay.  And anyone else live with you?"
"48","  No, okay.  All right.  Yeah, I think, I think, we could do that.  In terms of the checkup, I would love for us to do that as well.  I think, I think for a full checkup it would be really great if we could see you in person, so that we could do a physical exam and all of that.  Would that be okay with you?"
"49","  Time off from work."
"50","  Are there times that work better for you even during the weekdays?"
"51","  Yeah, so yeah, I totally understand that.  I think, I think, that's difficult, but I also, I love the idea of doing checkups and I love that you're willing to do it.  I think there are some clinics around that I say you doubt they are actually open in the evenings like, like 7 o'clock and if that will be a time that works for you, we could also do like doctors notes and so that, so that, you know we could communicate that with your employer."
"52","  Yeah, great."
"53","  Yeah, great.  So I'll have my, I'll have my scheduler call you and we can schedule that followup where you can come in and we can talk about kind of the health maintenance things to just kind of make sure that you're all doing okay which it sounds like other than kind of this going on lately, you've been doing okay otherwise."
"54","  Yeah, you're a pretty healthy guy, okay.  And so for the meantime, I think, I think you are doing just fine with that DayQuil.  I'd like you to continue that if you need, I think something else that you could do, if you already aren’t, it's just like drinking more water and resting and just letting your body heal, we can give it a few more days.  If this for whatever reason over the next week doesn’t start to get better, please give us a call and or if you start to feel like you have trouble breathing or having chest pain or your symptoms just get worse, please let us know or go to the emergency room."
"55","  How does all of that sound?"
"56","  Okay.  And we'll do the, we'll order the COVID test and you can do that whenever."
"57","  I believe that is the procedure, yeah and."
"58","  What's that?"
"59","  Okay, sounds like you know exactly what it is about.  And in this situation that this is COVID I would encourage and you too just kind of have social distance for a little while and so this kind of becomes less infectious, so that we can keep everybody safe."
"60","  Okay.  What questions do you have?"
"61","  Okay.  So, the COVID thing and we'll schedule a followup for that and general checkup and we'll make a more detailed plan on what we can do and hopefully by that time you'll be better.  You remember this too."
"62","  And okay, what questions do you have?"
"63","  Okay."
"64","  No, I'm really glad that you're coming to us now actually Tom.  I think this is really great, really happy to see you, really happy to meet you and I'm excited to see you in person and during that visit in person, we'll talk a lot more in detail about some of the more health maintenance things, and we'll do kind of the typical checkup and that's, we think about when we go to a doctor."
"65","  Okay.  That all sounds great to me, and it was so nice to talk to you Tom."
"66","  I owe you ____."
"67","  It was very good to talk with you.  I think, I think on my end of this visit I am finished.  I'm not sure exactly what you do at this point in terms of like leaving the meeting or."
"68","  Okay."
"69","  I think that's what we did last time actually.  So what I'll have you do Tom is, click on that red button, that leave and yeah and still like to leave meeting."
"70","  Okay.  It was nice to see you.  Take care."
"71","  And I hope you get better."
