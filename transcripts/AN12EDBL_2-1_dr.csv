"1","  Hey, Tom, I am not able to hear you.  It looks like you’re muted.  Okay, Tom, can you hear me?  I can’t hear you.  Yeah, looks like you’re muted.  Do you see the little microphone in the bottom left if you click on that, you should be able to unmute."
"2","  Here we go."
"3","  I still struggle with it, it’s been a year of this online electronic stuff things every day, but it’s great to see you.  Thanks so much for being here, Tom.  My name is David, I am the doctor for the day and it looks like you had a lot to tell me but you were muted.  So, if you ___ that would be great."
"4","  Yeah, well, it sounds like your girlfriend really cares about you and we want to make sure that you’re healthy as well.  So, thanks so much for being here."
"5","  And getting a COVID test is definitely something we could do today.  It sounds like from what I am hearing you, you have a cough, but you’re not really worried about it.  Do you have any other symptoms beyond the cough?"
"6","  Okay, yeah and how long this has been going on?"
"7","  Okay and any change in the last week, anything that happened about a week ago that you can think of?"
"8","  Okay.  And anyone sick around you?"
"9","  No, okay, your girlfriend is feeling fine?"
"10","  Okay and who else do you live with."
"11","  Yeah, absolutely she doesn’t want to expose everyone else."
"12","  And she is also probably interacting with a lot of people.  What about you, being mostly stayed at home or you going out."
"13","  Yeah, it’s hard to do construction work electronically."
"14","  You have to be there in person."
"15","  And thanks for doing that.  So, we can absolutely get a COVID test.  Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about now that we’re here connecting not necessarily in person, but is there anything else on your mind that you want me to know?"
"16","  Okay, perfect and we can definitely get that set up.  Is there anything that’s concerning you right now today that we should address today?  We can definitely set up a whole longer general checkup, we can talk about all the general health things, but I also want to make sure that you’re safe and okay right now.  Is there anything else beyond the coughs\ that’s going on that you want to talk about?"
"17","  Yeah, well, we can definitely put that on the ___."
"18","  I’ll make sure to make a note of that and we can get you scheduled and is this virtual format work best for you?  Would you want another checkup virtually?"
"19","  Yeah, yeah I definitely want to talk a little bit more about like COVID type symptoms than just the cold in general."
"20","  So, you mentioned cough and just kind of general tiredness.  Is there anything else that you’ve noticed?  I know you said no, but just thinking about COVID, any like fever or loss of smell or abdominal pain or diarrhea or anything else that you’ve heard about I guess sorry that was a weird way to say that, but anything else that you’ve been experiencing and maybe associated with COVID?"
"21","  Yeah, it definitely could be and any sore throat with that?"
"22","  Okay, any fever?"
"23","  Yeah..ummm any abdominal stuff, are you eating and drinking okay and going to the bathroom, alright?"
"24","  Okay, yeah well thanks for answering all those questions.  I know there is a lot going on.  I guess in my mind this could definitely be a common cold and it could also be COVID and we definitely want to make sure that we get that test today to try to get to the bottom of this just so that we can put your mind at ease and have a reasonable treatment plan going forward.  So, I think in my mind it makes sense to get a test now and do you know where the closest testing center might be to you?"
"25","  Okay, perfect.  I know they’re all around…they’re all around the Seattle area, go to the CDC website and you just type in your zip code, you can find out both where to get tested and then eventually down the road if you’re interested in the vaccine they have those available as well."
"26","  So, that would be my recommendation.  You can come to our clinic, but it’s all virtual, so I don’t know."
"27","  And you had mentioned you’ve been reading a lot about COVID.  Do you have any questions that I can answer about COVID in general you’ve been reading a lot, and it’s been bouncing around the news for about a year now.  Is there anything you want to address to that?"
"28","  Yeah, yeah."
"29","  Yeah, I am right there with you.  If there is so much information, it’s hard to know who to trust and where to go and there is a lot just bouncing around between friends too and just talk on the street, ones in the news and then the scientific literature, there is a lot going on and so I can totally empathize with where you are and even me as a doctor I sometimes struggle knowing where to turn for the right information."
"30","  Ahhh….but yeah I will say that it’s certainly an interesting virus and it does definitely kind of exacerbate some of the issues that we have in our country already.  There is people that don’t have access to healthcare and there is people that have underlying conditions that can make the disease worse for them and sometimes that’s based on decisions that person has made and sometimes that’s just a factor of where they live or what kind of decisions have been made for them like by previous generations or by the neighborhood where they were born and so.  There is a lot of different things going on with the virus and but all that to say if you get the virus, we want to make sure, so that we can get you into the right treatment and we can make sure that you’re not putting anybody else at risk.  So, if there is any I know it’s hard to talk in specifics I know it just spoke in generalities there but."
"31","  The virus itself is…uhhh… it’s something that we worry about and we definitely want to make sure that you’re safe and that your girlfriend is safe and then all the people that she is working with is safe as well as all the other construction workers.  So, I appreciate you coming in today, I appreciate you setting up this appointment and once we get that test, once those results come back, I will call you with the results and we will go from there."
"32","  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, is there anything else I can do for you before we sign off?"
"33","  Yeah, and either way we can have another conversation I know we wanted to schedule a general checkup and I would love to meet you again and talk to you just general health stuff and if you have any questions about COVID at that time, we can have a little bit more time to go a little bit deeper into that."
"34","  Perfect."
"35","  Get it."
"36","  And thanks for your time as a standardized patient, I appreciate it."
"37","  You have to sign off now."
