"1","  Hold on.  I can't hear you.  It looks like you're muted Freddie."
"2","  There you go, there you go. "
"3","  Hi, Freddie. How are you doing?"
"4","  Yeah, pretty good.  It's a pretty good day."
"5","  So, tell me what you want to talk about today."
"6","  Yeah."
"7","  How old are your kids?"
"8","  Grandkids? How old are your grandkids?"
"9","  Oh, that's going to take a lot of energy to keep up with, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Okay, well, tell me a little bit more about when you say you don't have energy, you know, tell me how that feels for you."
"10","  Tired?"
"11","  Yeah.  Tired as in sleepy or tired as in like weak?"
"12","  Okay.  But and it's not like a muscle weakness or anything like that?"
"13","  Okay.  Just kind of groggy slow.  Okay.  Alright.  Umm, are you having any other symptoms? Anything else been bothering you?"
"14","  Okay, alright, so you're not having any like headaches or problems breathing, chest pain, stomach issues?"
"15","  Your bowels are normal?"
"16","  Oh, are you…?"
"17","  Okay, you're peeing more than you usually do?"
"18","  Yeah, Okay. "
"19","  Okay.  Do you feel like, is there times that you feel it like an urgency like you've got to go right now or you're going to be incontinent?"
"20","  Okay.  Yeah, any pain when you urinate?"
"21","  Okay.  Or blood in the toilet?"
"22","  Okay.  And no fever or chills?"
"23","  Hahaha.  Okay.  How about any recent weight loss?  How's your weight been recently?"
"24","  Yeah.  Do you weigh yourself on a regular basis?"
"25","  Okay, that's cool, that's cool.  Do you find your clothes are fitting more loosely or anything like that?"
"26","  Okay.  That hasn't changed in the last time."
"27","  Okay, alright.  Just looking for all the different causes, um, and then tell me a little bit about like your other health issues.  I know we've been working with your diabetes."
"28","  Yeah. How have they been?"
"29","  Your glucose was 215."
"30","  Yeah, that's pretty high."
"31","   Yeah.  And that could definitely be contributing to #1 feeling tired and #2 urinating a lot actually.  So it could cause both of those.  So those could be linked in.  Tell me how is like, how are your medications working for you?  Are you having any problems taking them or any side effects or anything?"
"32","  Yeah, I know. I think we all forget occasionally."
"33","  Metformin?"
"34","  Glipizide.  How often do you think you miss a dose of those? once a week?"
"35","  Okay.  Couple of times a month, so not very much."
"36","  Okay.  So actually it sounds like you're taking them pretty well to me."
"37","  You're having any side effects from them?  Sometimes, the metformin can cause like diarrhea, stomach upset, and stuff like that.  We already talked about your bowels, didn't we?"
"38","  Ha, ha, ha, um, any other like changes in your life that you've like? Are you exercising more or less?"
"39","  Yeah.  Has that changed recently or is that kind of always been that way for you?"
"40","  Yeah, yeah.  Okay."
"41","  And your diet, has it changed at all?"
"42","  She sounds like a good wife, ha ha."
"43","  Hmm.  Okay.  Any changes in like I know in the past you've said that you don't smoke cigarettes and that you don't drink alcohol, you're you still…..any changes in that?"
"44","  Okay, "
"45","  Awesome.  Alright.  Hmm.  Okay.  Think I might be where I need to be.  Hmm.  Yeah."
"46","  Okay.  So yeah, I'll probably, for one thing I want to get some labs drawn and check on like…."
"47","  Yeah, I think so.  I think we'll probably get some labs drawn and check on your kidney function and will that work for you?"
"48","  It's not, it's not necessarily emergent, but you know actually and I would like for you to go ahead and get your labs drawn and then we'll make an appointment for you to come in. I just want to….because your sugars are running higher than they should and you're taking your medications correctly.  So I think maybe we need to work on your medications and then maybe talk more about diet and stuff, and if your wife comes with you, we can talk about how she can….."
"49","  Yeah, we can talk about changes she can make with cooking and stuff that can help that too, so."
"50","   So anyway, that's the plan."
"51","  Does that sound okay with you?  How do you feel about that?"
"52","  Okay.  Awesome."
"53","  Okay, well, you can go ahead and log off the Zoom.  I appreciate.  Thanks for spending the morning with me."
"54","  Yeah, I know. I know."
"55","  Thanks, Freddie. Bye, bye."
"56","  Hmm.  I think."
"57","   There should be a red leave thing."
