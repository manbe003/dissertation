"1","  Hello.  Hi, is this Tom?"
"2","  Hi Tom.  My name is Chrissy, I am one of the doctors working with you today.  How are you doing?"
"3","  Okay."
"4","  Okay, sorry to hear about that.  I was reading a little bit in your chart that it sounds like you have a little bit of a cough and a fever.  Can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"5","  Okay and if I am looking down, I am just taking some notes.  So I am here, I am present and listening."
"6","  Okay.  I am sorry to hear that.  When did this all start?"
"7","  Okay.  Have you ever felt like anything like this has happened before?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Okay, have you been tested before?"
"10","  Okay and then how do you feel about potentially getting tested?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Okay, thank you for sharing.  I can gather some more history and get an understanding of what kind of may be going on and then at the end, we can decide if we think that is the good option."
"13","  Does that sound okay?"
"14","  Yeah, okay.  So sounds like you have that cough starting three or four weeks ago, has it gotten better or worse since that time?"
"15","  Okay.  Does the cough wake you up at night?"
"16","  Okay.  Um, what about your girlfriend?  Is she sick as well?"
"17","  Okay, great.  Okay and then when did the fever start?"
"18","  Yeah."
"19","  Okay, and then what about energy level?  How has that been? How have you been feeling with that?"
"20","  Okay, so any other symptoms that you can think of, like a headache or anything like that?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  Okay.  Is there anything that helps the diarrhea, like relieves it?"
"23","  Okay, ha ha.  It is on and off once a week."
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Okay, and then have you been followed by any other specialists like a GI or anything like that to check in on the diarrhea?"
"26","  Okay, and then I guess kind of just to reassess the focus of today, would you like to focus mainly on the, on the cold symptoms?"
"27","  Okay, okay, so what I am hearing is that all these symptoms started a few weeks ago, cough, sometimes phlegm, taking DayQuil that seems to help, no headaches, a little bit of fatigue, but no.  I noted in your chart that you said that you didn't have any loss of taste and smell.  Is that still true?"
"28","  Okay, okay, and then any sort of aching or muscle, like muscle weakness?"
"29","  Okay."
"30","  Yeah, and then from a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being feeling the best you have ever been in your entire life and 10 being feeling like the absolute worst, where would you say you land now?"
"31","  Yeah."
"32","  4 or 5, okay."
"33","  Yeah."
"34","  Okay, okay.  Any difficulty breathing?"
"35","  Okay, okay.  May I ask you a few questions about your past medical history, any past colds or bronchitis or anything that you can think of in the past five years or so?"
"36","  Okay, um, any current medications you are on?"
"37","  Okay.  Any allergies?"
"38","  No allergies, okay.  And then what about, are you up to date?  How many shots immunization?"
"39","  Okay, I can look in the chart for that."
"40","  Do you remember receiving the COVID shot for this year?"
"41","  Did you receive a COVID vaccination for this year?"
"42","  Okay.  And then what about flu shot?"
"43","  Yeah, okay, okay.  And then what about, can you tell me a little bit about your diet and exercise?"
"44","  Okay."
"45","  Yeah, I know that is great.  I also love walking.  I live right around Green Lake, so it is always nice to get out on a nice sunny day."
"46","  Okay and then what about any family history of any medical condition that you can remember?"
"47","  Hm hm."
"48","  Okay, okay, okay, thank you for sharing all that information.  It really sounds like some things I am thinking about are just common cold, potentially a flu and COVID is actually on my thought of something that it could be as well.  So, if it is okay with you, I would be interested in getting tested for all of that.  The testing is very easy and if you are symptomatic, sometimes a home testing for COVID does pop positive, but an in-person testing, which is the PCR testing is going to be a little bit more accurate.  In terms of the flu and the cold, we can also do that in person as well."
"49","  Um, how do you feel about all of that?"
"50","  Yeah."
"51","  Okay, great, yeah.  So I think I want to get you tested first, just so that we can figure out what medications could help.  If it is, let's say a bacterial infection, we can give you some antibiotic medications, but if it is not, then it may not be worth it to get that.  So that is kind of why I was thinking to do testing first.  So, if that sounds good, I can after we are done chatting, we can, we can talk with the office to see a good time for you to come in to you get those tests."
"52","  Yeah and then another thing I wanted to chat a little bit with you, if you have some time is just a little bit about your immunization and your thoughts on getting a COVID vaccination as well and flu shot?"
"53","  Yeah, I know Tom, I think that is great.  I think that I agree, I, I would agree with what you are saying, I think it would be helpful to get both the flu and the COVID shots, just to help prevent the spread of COVID and also protect you from getting it in the future.  I would have to, I am gonna be honest, I would have to look up exactly when you can get it if you do have the current infection now, when you get in the future, so it may not be at the time when you come in to get tested, but I will touch base with you, and maybe we can plan it in the future.  Does that make sense?"
"54","  You can do both at the same time.  With the COVID shot, you do need a second booster later on, but for the COVID shot and the flu shot, you can do them both.  After the shots, you do feel, you can feel some symptoms of just fatigue and a little bit of like an achiness for maybe like a day or so.  But then for most people, they just kind of recover back."
"55","  Yeah."
"56","  Perfect."
"57","  Yeah, I know that sounds like a great idea.  That is what I ended up doing too, me kind of just hang out, had a little movie day and then the next day, we are up and back and walking and biking, you know."
"58","  All right Tom, do you have any other questions for me?"
"59","  Yeah."
"60","  Yeah, you know that is a great question.  So I think first I think just getting established with a primary care would be great.  So if you have it, if this is what this visit is, I am happy to be of your primary care and continue to follow you and see you annually is the ideal.  Um, do you know when the last time you had your colonoscopy was or if you have had a colonoscopy?"
"61","  Okay, so that would be one thing that we would be interested in potentially getting, especially given your history of the diarrhea."
"62","  So I think that could be something that we could talk about too.  And if the diarrhea is still bothering you and honestly with the three-year history, I would also be interested in connecting you to a gastroenterologist, who specializes is kind of looking at the gut and maybe deciphering further what may be going on there."
"63","  Yeah.  So if you, do you know if you are insurance needs referrals?"
"64","  Great.  I am so happy to put that in there, so I can put the referral in your chart and then you can go when you have time to go to see the gastroenterologist and I can put it in now and it should last for at least a good year or so, but sooner is better than later, okay.  Want to get you up and healthy first and then once you are feeling better from whatever this cold like thing ends up being, then we can get you connected there, okay."
"65","  Yeah, ha ha ha, yeah, and then maybe next time when we are in person, if you are getting the shot, it could be a good time since you have not been in for 10 years, just do a physical."
"66","  Always it is good to just kind of check in, we can check your blood pressure, um, take care, can take a listen to your heart and we can kind of go from there just to check in on all those numbers."
"67","  Okay, great.  Any more questions?"
"68","  Yes, I hope so too, hm."
"69","  All right, Tom.  It was nice seeing you."
"70","  Bye."
"71","  Okay."
