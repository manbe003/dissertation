"1","  Is this how to do it?"
"2","  Okay, good, thanks."
"3","  Computers can drive you nuts sometimes."
"4","  Yeah Sheila, thanks."
"5","  I don't really need to come in.  My girlfriend made me come in.  I'm still here, but I mean I just have a cold, she thinks I have COVID, so she wants me, she wants you to test me for COVID and figures as long as I'm here you ought to give me a general checkup because I only had one for about 10 years or more, so."
"6","  It has been since I guess Monday, maybe Sunday night."
"7","  And my nose is just like stuffed up nose, I cough a little bit, my throat itches, I'm kind of hot.  That's all I can think of, I don’t know."
"8","  I don't know, I just was hoping I'd shake it by the weekend and it's about the same, I guess."
"9","  Yes."
"10","  No, I used to have a thermometer.  I think my Ex has my thermometer.  I don't know how the…"
"11","  I can't really measure it now, I don't know.  But it just feels warm, you know, I can tell it's not quite right. "
"12","  No."
"13","  I've had colds before, I mean…"
"14","  No, I've never had COVID before, so I don't know whether I got that or not.  It's just everybody's talking about that, it will kill you and so is this like going to be the end or is this just a false alarm."
"15","  Well, I wasn’t, until my girlfriend started yelling at me about it.  So as far as I'm concerned, it's a false alarm, but…"
"16","  But she thinks, she seems to think I'd rather get checked out."
"17","  Not that I know of, no it's, anyway we wear masks at work and stuff, so and we're not working that close anyway."
"18","  Oh, DayQuil or NyQuil did seem to help a little bit."
"19","  Of what, no, I guess not, no."
"20","  No, not that I know of."
"21","  Make sure everything is okay and so I mean, how is it looking so far?"
"22","  Yeah."
"23","  Besides not liking to go to the doctor, I mean is that a condition?  That is, that I know of, I mean, does it seem like I do or I mean, oh that's so much."
"24","  How do we that here?  I mean, yeah, you cannot do anything online and I mean, so do I go into the office or which, I haven’t been to, I don't even know where the office is, now jeez, where will I go?"
"25","  I'm up on Beacon Hill."
"26","  Well, yeah, I can arrange that somehow, yeah.  So I have to drive someplace to do this?"
"27","  Okay, I guess very good, need to get it going, so…"
"28","  Just I want to make sure everything is okay.  Anything else that you want to look at or I mean, talk about or I don't know, what else do we need to do."
"29","  I guess so, as long as I'm here might as well get it done."
"30","  No."
"31","  No."
"32","  Oh, my mom had beast cancer, but she survived that just fine, but she passed away a couple of years ago, natural causes I guess. "
"33","  And then my grandpa had some kind of cancer, I guess, I think it was colon cancer, I'm not sure.  I was a kid so I don't really know his history."
"34","  I was a kid, everybody was old."
"35","  I didn’t know you could do it yourself. "
"36","  Oh no, no."
"37","  Is there a reason why I have to do this or…?"
"38","  I get diarrhea every once in a while."
"39","  Okay, I guess, yes."
"40","  No."
"41","  No."
"42","  Yes, just strange for us for sure.  I don't know, I just figure things will work out eventually, so I just let things go."
"43","  No, I never fell for that."
"44","  Yes, yes."
"45","  Well, if she says, let's do this one at a time, here so I don't think anybody else is going to be involved anytime soon. "
"46","  They are all pretty good I think.  Really and I'm in construction, I'm active all the time.  I'm always working outside."
"47","  And Emily, that's my girlfriend, Emily and I like to ride bikes, so we are out a couple times a week at least."
"48","  Sometimes I go camping on weekends or something."
"49","  Just beer."
"50","  I drink a few beers at dinner time usually that’s about it."
"51","  No, no, no, kind of two or three, you know, maybe four."
"52","  No, not, it's, hasn’t changed much over the years, it's pretty steady."
"53","  Well, I don't know.  I guess that that's all we needed to do, the COVID shot and so you can arrange or we can arrange all those things where I go and when I do that, then I mean, how do we schedule things?"
"54","  Yeah."
"55","  Okay, well I'm not very good with a computer, ______ very much.  I borrowed this so ______.  And how do I make an appointment for the colonoscopy?"
"56","  I just don't know where I'm supposed to go next or when.  So…"
"57","  Okay.  So is there anything else we need to just to look at or?"
"58","  I guess that's it, yeah, okay."
"59","  Okay, thanks.  What do I, how do I stop this thing now that it's going?"
"60","  Oh, okay and this is…"
