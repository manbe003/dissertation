"1","  Okay."
"2","  Hello?"
"3","  You’re fading in and out actually."
"4","  Better, okay, okay."
"5","  I was supposed to come in months ago to check my numbers and stuff and I had some problems with my last provider who was resistant."
"6","  So now I’m a little late."
"7","  I do not think so."
"8","  Because that is what brings me in here certainly."
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  It has gotten me worried."
"11","  Yeah maybe, maybe I can get this closer a little bit.  Yes, it has gotten me kind of worried because."
"12","  Sure."
"13","  It has been creeping up on."
"14","  And, you know, it’s easy to ascribe it to just that immediate, proximate cause, but it has become clear that when I get home from work I don’tt have the energy for the grandkids."
"15","  And I did before, and I want to, so that is the kind of the objective observation that made me realize that I was ______."
"16","  8, 5 and 2."
"17","  No, it is my job too when I get home because my wife is so tired, she makes dinner for all of us and so I’m home and then the kids are still bugging her, because I am."
"18","  No, they just get dropped off because my daughter and her husband need the child care, so and so especially my wife looks after them.  We have been able to pick up that job."
"19","  Well, the kids does not live with us, they just get dropped off."
"20","  I would say months."
"21","  No, no."
"22","  Yes, yes."
"23","  No, I have got it worked on, I worked on that when I was younger."
"24","  No, just it makes me get really lower energy or I have been feeling more as I get older, but now I am like I am getting up more and more time you know ______."
"25","  Getting up from two to three to three to four ….and I think that that may contribute to the fatigue."
"26","  Yeah, yeah."
"27","  No."
"28","  No, not, I’m not seeing any signs of that."
"29","  To pee."
"30","  That is not the, I mean, I have known what it feels like when its, you know, what it feels like it is emptying, but that has been very rare and that is not the feeling.  Now I feel like I go and I pee, I mean I know it is a feeling of hope, you know it is like, oh good, I really, really emptied my bladder there at 3"
"31","  Then it happens again."
"32","  Yeah, yeah, that’s what it is."
"33","  No, I mean, you know, I feel like I have been ______ for being worn down, but not, yeah but not depressed or hopeless.  It does not feel like a mood issue.  It feels like, I am rationally coping with where I am at this point in my life."
"34","  I am not eager to."
"35","  I mean, if it were, every medication carries whether the possibility, if I, you know, if I think it is interrupting with my ability to get a good night's sleep or something, or ______ getting in the way at work, I have not considered that but yeah, no.  I am trying to keep my lifestyle as much as possible as it is."
"36","  That is how I feel about it, yeah."
"37","  Oh, I mean, my numbers have been going up."
"38","  Yeah, and I do not want to have to go on insulin.  So yeah, I’m just hoping, yes they told me to get off fried chicken last time and I do not believe that."
"39","  I am not chewing down on you know, 12 drumsticks every weekend.  I can cut off from some of the dinner but for chicken if you tell me, that might make a difference.  And then they were telling me to go out and hike the Olympics after work, I am exaggerating, you know, but."
"40","  So, yeah, and so I am just hoping, yeah, to be guided on what I have to do versus what I do not have to do.  So I am not, I am dying and I want to live as I live for as long as I can, without having to put a needle in my arm.  I check my blood sugar a couple of times a week, you know.  I hate that enough and but they warned me that when the numbers got to about 8 that I might you know worry and last time it was getting real close.  So, but I just, I had this reaction to being given orders, but I do not feel good about that.  I would always be the cranky old man who is stupid."
"41","  Yes, but people from my high school class have already died, you know, while often enough they spoke about how nobody is going to tell them to, you know, well, you know, that is my definition of stupid.  But, you know, but my wife and I did take the extra, you know, walk around the block once or twice on days when the grandkids are not there or we can coax them into going with us, you know, but there is just not a lot of time and frankly my wife isn’t really into becoming a specialty cook you know.  When she cooks, she can make me good healthy steak and a baked potato and you know I have, I like ice cream for dessert, but I’m not downing a pint and I am going to, a scoop or two and really enjoying it, you know, they are things that round off the day and make me feel human.  So, I ran from my last appointment and now I’m here to try to catch up and make sure that I have it done."
"42","  Well, super enthusiastic is."
"43","  Yeah, yeah, great."
"44","  Metformin and glipizide."
"45","  Every other week."
"46","  Every other week I miss a dose."
"47","  No, no."
"48","  Tolerating fine."
"49","  Twice a week."
"50","  It has climbed into the yellow like 215."
"51","  I try do a fasting."
"52","  No."
"53","  I have heard about stool samples."
"54","  I do not mind getting a stool sample."
