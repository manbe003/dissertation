"1","  Hello."
"2","  Hi, are you Mr. Johnson?"
"3","  Hi, I'm Megan."
"4","  I'm a medical student who will be talking to you today about what's bringing you in.  See. Well, I guess, through the Zoom call."
"5","  And see how we can help you today."
"6","  Sounds good.  So, I was looking at your chart before you came in, and it sounds like you were having a cough and some fever and that you wanted to talk about."
"7","  Okay.  Is there anything else?"
"8","  Yeah."
"9","  Sorry, there's something in the chart, but that, that's fair.  So do you also want to get checked out head to toe?"
"10","  But you don't have any concerns yourself?"
"11","  Okay, cool.  So would it be okay if because it's a little hard on a Zoom call to do the full checkout, you know, from head to toe, maybe schedule an in-person appointment for that and just focus on the fever and cough for today?"
"12","  That's okay, okay.  Then, like you know, what you have to do is all the good stuff that's more possible in person than on a Zoom call, ha ha."
"13","  Yeah.  Okay.  So you said you've been having a cough for about a week or so.  Is that accurate?"
"14","  Okay.  And you said you've been feeling warm."
"15","  Okay.  Has that also been for about a week or how long has that been for?"
"16","  Okay.  Anything else that you've noticed in the last week, like, have you been sneezing?"
"17","  Yeah.  Okay.  So you have the cough and you have been feeling warm.  Have you used like a thermometer or anything to check your temperature?"
"18","  Yeah.  Okay.  That makes sense.  Okay, but you haven't been sneezing, any runny nose?"
"19","  A little bit of both?  Okay.  And those are new in the last week?"
"20","  Okay, okay.  And have you been having any symptoms in your, like, digestive tract, any diarrhea or discomfort in your stomach?"
"21","  Okay, so more a long-term problem, not something this last week."
"22","  Okay, okay.  And is anyone around you sick?"
"23","  Not that you know of?  Okay.  Do you live with anyone?"
"24","  Yeah."
"25","  Uh, well, it sounded like you wanted to check in on the cough and the fever for yourself."
"26","  Yeah.  Hahaha.  Well, we appreciate you coming in and hopefully we can help you out a little bit or make sure that is not anything that is too concerning or get you to sort of what you need to make you feel a little bit better.  So, have you been feeling differently in any way like your energy levels?"
"27","  A little, sorry?"
"28","  Sorry, can you repeat that?"
"29","  Okay, okay.  And is that new?  Is that like the last week?"
"30","  Okay.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That's no fun."
"31","  Has it been like you're like falling asleep early or sort of, you know, you sit down to like read a book or something or watch TV and then you fall asleep?  Or is it just like you're kind of dragging through the day?"
"32","  Okay.  Have you been sleeping okay?"
"33","  Um, um.  Can you tell me more about that? Like when, when can or can't you sleep?"
"34","  Hmm hmm.  Okay.  So sometimes you're coughing so much that it wakes you up or keeps you awake?"
"35","  Hmm hmm.  Okay.  Does that happen like more or less at a certain time of day, the cough?"
"36","  Mostly when?"
"37","  Okay."
"38","  Okay.  And have you tried any medications for either the fever or the cough or anything like?"
"39","  Yeah, okay, so something that does both like it, it's a cough suppressant and like makes you sleepy like one of the p.m. ones, something like that?"
"40","  Did those help at all?"
"41","  Okay.  Do they like make it a little bit better or like it only works for a short time?"
"42","  Okay, okay.  And do you have any… I know it sounds like you haven't been to a doctor in a while, but the last time you were at the doctor, do you remember if they told you that you had any like ongoing medical issues that they wanted to keep an eye on?"
"43","  Awesome. That's great.  Hahaha.  Okay.  And have you been feeling as fit as a fiddle until like this last week or so?"
"44","  Awesome.  Okay.  And do you have any family history of like heart problems or anything like that?"
"45","  And you have never had or been told that you have like elevated blood pressure or hypertension, anything like that?"
"46","  Good, alright.  Just want to double check because sometimes the cough can be sort of heart related."
"47","  But it sounds like not so much for you."
"48","  Okay, and what do you do with your days? Are you working or what do you do?"
"49","  Oh, cool, okay.  Are you?  You're in Seattle, right?"
"50","  _______ wrap.  Yeah, constructions everywhere.  Hahaha."
"51","  Yeah.  Okay.  And has anyone at work been feeling sick or coughing or anything like that?"
"52","  Not that you know of, okay.  And do you have like COVID precautions in place at work, like wearing a mask?"
"53","  Yeah.  Um, I think given your symptoms, that wouldn't be unreasonable just to double check."
"54","  What would you think about getting a COVID test?"
"55","  Hmm hmm.  Umm, okay.  COVID precautions at work.  Just because you know some of the symptoms of COVID are a cough and you've had one for a little while, and the fever and fatigue are like three of the top symptoms that people with COVID can have.  They're not the only ones, and COVID is not the only one that causes them, but it would definitely be like our best recommendation for you to get tested and then if it does come out positive, do you know if your work has a protocol for that?"
"56","  Yeah, okay.  So would that be okay in case it does come back positive?"
"57","  Yeah, hahaha, ideally, yeah, okay.  Just want to make sure that you wouldn't have too many concerns with getting the test."
"58","  Okay, alright.  Have you been tested before?"
"59","  No, it's just kind of like a random?"
"60","  Yeah.  So is it just like a random testing or is it like a regular schedule for you all?"
"61","  Okay, do you remember when your last one was?"
"62","  Okay, so not too recently."
"63","  Okay, no worries, no worries.  Okay, so definitely I think getting a COVID test would make sense to make sure whether it is or isn't that.  Umm.  The other possibilities, do you ever have allergies?"
"64","  None that you know of, okay.  And have you ever noticed that like do you typically get like a cough or sneezing at certain times of the year or anything or like every year you're like, gosh, I have this cold again, anything like that?"
"65","  Okay, so this is unusual for you to have the cough."
"66","  You are not someone who gets sick too often?"
"67","  Yeah, yeah, you said, haha,  okay.  I'm sorry about that.  I hope you'll be back to being fiddle worthy soon. I hope."
"68","  Okay.  And did you get a flu shot this year?"
"69","  No flu shot?"
"70","  Okay, that's fair.  The flu shot is hopefully to help you keep from getting sick, but I get that if you don't encounter the flu, it can be less desirable.  Yeah.  Did you get the COVID vaccine by any chance?"
"71","  Okay, are you interested in it at all?"
"72","  Hmm hmm.  Because if this is a COVID scare, you might think a little bit more about getting the vaccine."
"73","  Yeah.  Do you have any concerns about the vaccine?"
"74","  No.  Okay.  Has the opportunity come up for you to get it yet or?"
"75","  Hmm.  Okay.  Okay.  But you're just taking your time thinking about it or?"
"76","  Okay, that's fair.  Umm.  We really like to encourage the vaccine because, you know, COVID has been such a, I don't know, huge sort of disruption to life and the vaccine does help a lot with like preventing these sorts of scares that, um, so if you're having now because it's so good at preventing disease.  It might be something to think about that you could just have that extra safety blanket."
"77","  Okay.  Okay.  And maybe when you come in for that sort of full checkup, you could talk a little bit more about the vaccine then."
"78","  Okay, okay, so it sounds like, what I'm hearing from you mostly is you've had a cough for about a week, you've been feeling warm, and you've had low energy.  The cough has been keeping you up, as is the heat, so it's really been bothering you and the over-the-counter meds haven't really helped you."
"79","  Is there anything else that's been going on that I missed?"
"80","  Okay, alright, so I think what would make a lot of sense is to get the COVID test.  Do you know where you could get one?"
"81","  Yeah, okay.  And like one of the city things or somewhere else?"
"82","  Yeah.  So drive through one of those, get the tests.  Hopefully, it comes back negative; and like in the meantime, keep like taking it easy.  Have you been sort of hydrating and eating things that make you feel better?"
"83","  Yeah.  Keep on that track while we figure out whether this is COVID or not, and then if that can be, if we can decide whether or not, the yes or no, just stay in contact and see if this maybe….hopefully this is also just a cold that'll go away.  And if you continue to still feel down and like the cough doesn't seem to be resolving, check back in.  Does that seem reasonable?"
"84","  Okay.  Is there anything else?"
"85","  Okay.  So, I think the COVID results like sort of automatically update, and if it's positive, they'll let you know.  And you can also check it online.  The negative will also pop up, but the positive is like, we try much harder to get a hold of you and let you know that."
"86","  And then they can let you know the next steps in that case."
"87","  Okay? yeah."
"88","  Alright.  Is that okay?"
"89","  Alright, thanks for talking to me today, even if your girlfriend made you do it."
"90","  Alright, I hope the test is helpful, and if not, we'll circle back and see if there's something else we should be testing for you or checking out for you."
"91","  Alright."
"92","  Okay, alright.  I will let you go.  And we'll be in touch about the test results, okay?"
"93","  Alright.  Thank you, Tom.  It was nice to meet you."
