"1","  Hi there, you must be Tom?"
"2","  Freddie okay. Nice to meet you Freddie.  My name is student doctor, Dr. Myers and I will be taking care of you today.  Can you tell me a little bit what brings you in today?"
"3","  Okay, great.  Well, I am glad you came in.  It sounds like you are, you know thinking about things and have had some new symptoms, the tiredness so, yeah, we'll see what we can do about that today. What do you normally do to help manage your diabetes?"
"4","  Okay, all right.  Are you checking your blood sugars at home as part of that?"
"5","  Okay.  And how are you feeling about your diet and exercise kind of your routines?"
"6","  That's nice to have a spouse who cooks, I am sure but yeah, maybe we can talk about some of the foods we like to think more about eating with diabetes and have her coming in at some point if that's something we need to talk about altogether, but we can think about that more in the future too, that's something that would be helpful.  Great to hear you are walking and moving, we like to see that with diabetes and also just with health in general it is good for your heart and brain, it keeps you moving.  All right, so can you tell me a little bit more about what the tiredness you've been experiencing has looked like?"
"7","  Okay, yes, so if I am hearing right, sounds like your goal is really to just have a little more energy to be able to interact with grandkids and do your job and day-to-day activities."
"8","  Okay, all right.  Yeah, and some of that you probably had this before sometimes fatigue can go along with changes in your blood sugar, so I would like to today do a blood test called HbA1c which will look at the average of your blood sugar over three months, you probably had this done before if you've had diabetes for some time."
"9","  Okay, it sounds familiar to you?"
"10","  Okay, all right.  Yeah, so we'll do that and it will give us some more information about where things have been if there has been a big change like have you noticed at home that your blood sugars have been in a higher range or lower range, any changes?"
"11","  Okay.  Yeah, those color zones can be helpful or just kind of knowing when we're not getting in the range that we want to be which is the green like is more associated with better energy and also just would be better for your body over time with diabetes, but it sounds like you are making good changes with the exercise and the metformin.  We might consider just increasing you medications a little bit to more see if that will help, but I would like to see what the A1c is first because it has been a bit since you've been in."
"12","  Does that make sense to you?  And then we can go from there.  We could even, what we could is I could call you with the result and let you know what medication change might be helpful that as the guide.  All right, go ahead."
"13","  Okay, is that happening during a certain time of the day?"
"14","  Yeah, yeah, I imagine, sleep is so important.  So that would be very bothersome.  Have you ever had anything like this before or is it your first time with this issue?"
"15","  Okay.  Yeah, and urination, more urination can be a side effect of, it can be part of diabetes, the bigger diabetes picture because when the blood sugar is higher the body wants get rid of it, some of that higher sugar, and what it does is sometimes makes you urinate more to help get rid of some of those extra glucose molecules floating around, so it might be part of that.  We'll also look at, we'll do an urine test today just to make sure you are not having an infection or to check if there is any blood in your urine or that will also, we'll also do another test that will tell us if there is protein in your urine because sometimes diabetes affects the kidneys and makes some more protein excrete too.  So we'll check that and then I can call you with that result again to or I'd actually like, what do you think about if we can do a followup in little sooner time maybe more like a month from now and or even two, I would actually really like two weeks, two weeks work for you to come back in talk about the results and go over how we can make some medication changes?  I'll let you know over the phone, but we could even make that medication change in the next few days after the result and then see how that's going for you."
"16","  Okay.  And just to double check with that frequent urination, any blood in your urine or any associated like pain with the urination?"
"17","  No, okay, okay, okay, good to hear.  And also sometimes with age especially men can have some more frequent urination so that could be part of this too but that, those tests will be some good information for us so. Okay, let's see.  Any other new symptoms or things that have been bothering you?"
"18","  No, okay. All right, it sounds like so to kind of summarize we're talking, you've been doing a really great job with exercising, have been trying to take your medication and check your blood sugar regularly which is, both those are great.  I an wanting to address the tiredness more though so we're going to check the diabetes HbA1c, see where that is at, maybe make a medication changes to see that helps with your energy levels and also decreasing that blood sugar so we'll get that lab work done today after this and then the second thing with the frequent urination that's been pretty bothersome with your sleep, so we'll check urinalysis and we'll also check your urine protein, protein creatinine ratio to see what that looks like too."
"19","  Okay?"
"20","  And then we'll do a followup in two weeks to discuss the results and make any changes and maybe would you be open to having your wife come for that followup and we can even dive into diet?"
"21","  Yeah, yeah. And I would really like to meet her too so I think that will be perfect.  So great, okay it was great to meet you Freddie.  I think we've got a good just starting point here.  How do you feel about my conversation today and our plan moving forward?"
"22","  Yeah, yeah, we can definitely talk about more of those effects.  It sounds like you are already thinking about them.  So, and I would like to answer more questions.  And one other thing I just thought of when you made that last comment is could you write down your blood sugar levels in a little piece of paper like a log book and bring that in next time?"
"23","  Okay great, because that will also give us some good information to talk about next time."
"24","  And then we'll set up to make sure, have you had an eye exam as well in the last year that's something we think about making use of."
"25","  Okay, all right well I'll have my nurse set up, would you be open to having an eye exam?"
"26","  Okay we'll get that set up too so when we set up my nurse can back in and set up your next appointment in two weeks and then she will also talk about getting an eye exam set up just like you said so we're checking into all the things that diabetes affect because it can affect the eyes we like to have an annual eye exam for people with diabetes to double check that."
"27","  All right."
"28","  Okay."
"29","  Yeah, yeah, me too, all right."
"30","  Thank you so much Freddie, have a nice rest of your day."
"31","  Great to meet you.  Bye-bye. "
