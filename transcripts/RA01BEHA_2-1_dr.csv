"1","  Hi, there.  I think you’re muted.  There should be an un-mute button at the top of your-your video."
"2","  Yes, it is.  Hi, I am Natasha.  Are you Mr. Johnson."
"3","  How are you doing today?"
"4","  I have on my sheet that you are here today to discuss possible COVID and then some health maintenance items.  Is there anything else we need to talk about today?"
"5","  Okay, let’s start with the symptoms that you’re feeling today, what’s going on?"
"6","  I am sorry to hear that.  How long has this been going on?"
"7","  A week, okay."
"8","  Have you had a fever or anything like that?"
"9","  Okay, okay, are you taking anything that’s helping you feel any better?"
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Okay, have you been around anybody who is sick?"
"12","  Okay and have you been vaccinated against COVID?"
"13","  Okay, do you know if you are up-to-date on your other vaccinations?"
"14","  Okay."
"15","  Okay, so, about a week of a cough and feeling crummy and maybe some fevers."
"16","  Okay.  Are you having any trouble breathing?"
"17","  Okay.  Are you having any chest pain?"
"18","  Okay, okay, sounds good.  Well it does sound like it could be COVID given everything that’s going on.  I think that definitely you could get a test just to know for certain but I think also just staying home for the next couple of days is probably an okay option as well and just making sure that you’re not getting anybody else sick, self quarantine."
"19","  What do you think of that?"
"20","  Maybe it would be a good idea then to go in and get a test and just know for sure."
"21","  Like a test to know if you have COVID or not, there is a couple of different types that they can do like they can just swab your nose and it will let you know pretty fast if you had it or not because if you do have it, I would recommend you staying home so you don’t get anybody else sick."
"22","  You could go to a pharmacy, you could probably go to any clinic or any hospital, lot of people are doing that for test right now."
"23","  I don’t know."
"24","  Okay, any other symptoms that you’re having associated with this week, coughing things like that, that we talked about?"
"25","  You haven’t been sleeping or you have been sleeping?"
"26","  Okay, in the daytime?"
"27","  Okay, do you feel well rested when you wake up in the morning?"
"28","  What do you mean by crummy?"
"29","  Okay, so that’s just associated with this, but that hasn’t been going on longer than the?"
"30","  What’s been going on, okay, okay, just wanted to make sure that wasn’t going on a week for all of these symptoms."
"31","  Okay, okay and then the other thing I would just recommend is you can keep taking you know Tylenol, ibuprofen either of those things if they help you feel a little bit better to help with your fever.  Unfortunately, if it is a viral infection which is kind of what it sounds like there is not any medicines we can take to make it get any faster.  The other thing that I would say is that if you start to have any trouble breathing like your coughing gets worse or if you’re up and walking around you can’t catch your breath that maybe would be a sign that’s something more is going on and I think it would be a good idea at that point to go to an emergency room."
"32","  Does that sound good?"
"33","  Okay, good.  I am glad to hear that and then I also have on my list that you want to discuss just some general health maintenance items today, is that correct?"
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Fair enough.  Well, let me make sure that I am up-to-date on everything that’s going on with you, I don’t have it that you have any medical problems.  Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical problems before like hypertension, diabetes, any of those sort of things?"
"36","  Okay, do you take any medicines regularly?"
"37","  No, okay, okay, sounds good.  Do you smoke cigarettes?"
"38","  Okay, do you drink alcohol?"
"39","  How often and how much?"
"40","  Once a day two or three beers."
"41","  Okay, sounds good.  Do you ever use any other substances?"
"42","  Okay, okay, sounds good.  So, the other thing that I think is important to talk about in this like sort of health maintenance visit is just diet and exercise, what does your diet look like in the normal week?"
"43","  Okay, what about any exercise?"
"44","  Sorry, I didn’t mean to take you off at lunch keep going."
"45","  Okay, what about for dinner?"
"46","  Okay and then do you get any exercise in the week?"
"47","  Awesome, that’s great."
"48","  That’s awesome, okay.  Well, let’s start with ways that we think we could improve sort of the things that we’ve already talked about, you said you’re drinking two to three beers at night which is a little bit more than we recommend, for males we recommend that most two per nights, do you have any interest in cutting back at all in your drinking?"
"49","  Okay, sounds good.  Well, I will still state the recommendation and then if you ever feel like that’s something that you’re interested in it’s definitely something that we could talk about more."
"50","  How do you feel your diet is, do you feel like making any changes in that area of your life?"
"51","  You’re not hungry?"
"52","  Okay, well one of the things with diet is it can cause one of those symptoms that maybe we don’t see right away like it can be delayed many, many years making positive changes now can have impacts later in life and there is always options if you are curious about things in the future like nutritionist or dieticians people like that they can give better information about a balanced diet if that was ever something that you are interested in.  The other thing that I wanted to mention just since you’re here for a health maintenance visit is sounds like we could give you some vaccines today if you’re interested.  We do recommend the COVID vaccine even if you do have COVID right now and then of course the flu vaccine every year, would you be interested in any of those sort of things?"
"53","  Okay, okay.  Well, I know it’s hard and that means you have to go out and get to a pharmacy can’t do a vaccine virtually but it’s definitely something that we recommend and it’s definitely something that it can help you and help your community if you’re vaccinated.  So, I really recommend that in the future."
"54","  And then the other things that we do around your age that we recommend is a colonoscopy, have you ever done that before or colon cancer screening I should say?"
"55","  Okay, are you interested in colon cancer screening?"
"56","  Well, there is a couple of different, what’s colon cancer?"
"57","  Okay."
"58","  So, a colonoscopy is a procedure that is done where they uses scope and they look through your colon and the recommendation now is actually for people to start getting at the age of 45, and if they get a clean bill of health from that, then they have to do it every 10 years.  I will say that some people aren’t really interested in getting the colonoscopy done because it’s a procedure where you have to go over you know you’re sedated and you have to go through a whole cleanse and all the sort of stuff.  So, there are other options like."
"59","  That’s fair enough.  There are other options like the testing where you can send the stool sample to the lab.  The benefit of that is that you don’t have to get a colonoscopy, but the con is that you have to do that every year instead of every 10 years."
"60","  Okay, fair enough, that’s sounds like a good option then."
"61","  And let’s see what else we should do, do you, have you ever had your blood work checked, do you remember ever having that done recently?"
"62","  Okay."
"63","  Okay, well that’s probably another thing that I am going to recommend is we’ll just get some routine lab work done so we can look for things like high fats, high lipids in your blood and diabetes things like that just so we can understand kind of where you’re at with those sort of things and then maybe you can make one stop and get your vaccines and then get your blood work done at the same time, how does that sound?"
"64","  Okay, fair enough, fair enough.  Well, we talked about a lot of things today, do you have any questions about the things that we talked about?"
"65","  No, okay.  So, our plan will be I recommend the COVID test to know if you have COVID or not and then just wearing your mask when you’re on public and if you do have COVID staying home until your symptoms are better and then I’ll send for the stool test to check for colon cancer, and then I recommend the vaccines and the blood work, which you will think about."
"66","  Is there anything else we need to talk about today?"
"67","  Okay.  Well, I hope you feel better soon, not very fun to be sick."
"68","  All right, thank you."
