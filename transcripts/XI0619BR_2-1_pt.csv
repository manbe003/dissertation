"1","  How is that?"
"2","  Yes, I was just kind of it all kind of disappeared when I was down there."

"8","  Well, I am okay, I get up and I feel pretty good and I have my breakfast and coffee and stuff and I go to work I am fine so but by the time the afternoon gets there I get kind of just petered out."
"9","  And the annoying part is my wife is taking care of our grandkids and I want to go home be able to play with them for a while you know because they are just cuter and well the 2-year-old he is just in there you know, so I got to kind of watch him all the time otherwise, you know, burning the house down, but yeah when I get in the afternoon, I just feel like I am just tired and sleepy."
"10","  Well, I used to get some like a caffeinated soft drink or something in the afternoon to try to perk myself up a little bit, but that just, I do not know, it does not seem to last that much."
"11","  I have not really noticed anything there."
"12","  Yeah."
"13","  Yeah, yeah,  it seems to be late after around 3 I think."

"15","  Not anything unusual."
"16","  Okay.  Or like tingly ness or anything like that?"

"18","  I never noticed any.  I do not temperature a whole lot, but I have not felt particularly feverish or sick or anything."
"19","  I think, I pee a little bit more."
"20","  Oh, I have not really clocked it.  I think about four or five times."
"21","  Probably about three I guess.  It might be more like six actually I do not think about it but I will look into that.  It just seems like oh time I got to go pee again."
"22","   No, no."
"23","  Sometimes."
"24","  Okay."
"25","  Oh maybe.  I really noticed about like three months ago I think I do not pay a whole lot of attention to it, I just kind of pee when I feel like."
"26","  That was like, somebody mentioned that you were taking a lot of pee breaks while working."
"27","  Oh, I work at Mirabella Retirement Home."
"28","   And my job title is home care coordinator."
"29","  Basically, if anything goes wrong, I have to deal with it. "
"30","  Everybody comes to me if they are problems, you know."
"31","  I start to work, oh, I have, "
"32","  That's it as far as I am going to think of."
"33","  Yeah."
"34","  Yes."
"35","  Yeah."
"36","  Yeah;"
"37","  That was about a year ago."
"38","  I check my blood sugar a couple of times a week, all the time."
"39","  It was 215."
"40","  Oh, anywhere from like 200 to highest some 215 at times."
"41","  I am, you mean the fatigue? "
"42","  The blood sugar I always check at the morning."
"43","  Before I have breakfast."
"44","  Oh, I have taken to exercise.  I have been taken to the walking with my wife."
"45","  Walk like about a couple, three times a week."
"46"," Let me think here.  I have breakfast.  I got coffee, maybe some eggs, and hash browns with butter."
"47","  Lunch. Yeah, I go to the McDonald's just down the road, just because I got to get away.  It is, you know, I get some time off here and I have like I got like 1/4 pounder, maybe some fries and a coke."
"48","  Dinner is, whatever, my wife would generally do all the cooking.  So she is like steak and potatoes and I might have a coconut bowl of ice cream, but we have, we have some fried chicken on the weekends. "
"49","  Sure, sure."
"50","  I feel pretty good about that whole thing, yeah."
"51","  But it is hard to work in my wife, most of the cooking and you know I do not want to, you know, have her do something she does not want to do, you know? "
"52","  And. I, like I said, had to get away from those."
"53","  Whole folks while I am eating."
"54","  So the only place around there is McDonald's.  So that is kind of you know.  That is kind of been my last thing, yes."
"55","  Well , tank you.  "
"56","  You think of actually having an apple."
"57","  Wow.  Apple is just fine, I guess. "
"58","  Yeah, that will be good.  I would like a little bit if you could do."

"60","  Let me look at that list."
"61","  Yeah, so it would be in addition to the glipizide or?"
"62","  When you say insulin, that does not mean I have to shoot it, right."
"63","  Yeah, because I am fine, I am good with like you know if you want to up maybe a different drug or something that would be better, just needles give me you know "
"64"," That would be okay."
"65","  Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"66","  I cannot think of this thing, next thing you know, I would have thought about it. I think that that seems pretty you know, modifying the drugs would be fine. Yeah."
"67","  okay, I think I got a little bit of sick time available."
"68","  Okay."
"69","  No, I think that would be it. "
"70","  Yeah, you too."
