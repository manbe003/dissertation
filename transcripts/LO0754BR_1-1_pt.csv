"28","  Yeah."
"29","  Oh, I do not, I might have missed one every couple of weeks or so."
"30","  Yeah, yeah, I’m taking my medication."
"31","  Well, I don’t feel like that, but when I went in before I had this like tingling in my legs."
"32","  That was like eight years ago when I got diagnosed and I have not had anything like that."
"33","  Well, I have been taking a walk with my wife like a couple of times a week."

"38","  Well, I get that when I have to work, I expect a little more than that over the weekends that is like, It is like still sleep in a bit."
"39","  This has got me actually confused, they told me, somebody said it was like it could be the diabetes that is making you tired and I do not know."
"40","  Yeah, is there something else?"
"41","  Oh, I do not know, that is the thing that really bothers me about this whole thing is this getting so tired, you know?  It is, you know, yes, it is usual if you get a little bit tired when you get off work, but not like just dog tired and just…"
"42","  That would be good…"
"43","  Okay, okay.  That is reasonable."
"44","  Oh yeah, I think I do too, I do too.  You know, they are only that age like, they grow up so fast."
"45","  Okay, thank you very much."
