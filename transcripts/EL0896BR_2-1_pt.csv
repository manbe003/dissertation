"1","  Yeah."
"2","  Is that the? Is that the one that is?"
"3","  Sorry, I get."
"4","  Technology kind of confuses me, I guess."
"5","  Yeah, so.  So what do I do now, I mean."
"6","  I have never been on a computer."
"7","  Great."
"8","  Yeah, I do not go to the doctor very much.  I have not been there in about at least 10 years I guess, but my girlfriend made me, made this appointment.  I have got a cold, that is all it is. "
"9","  But she wanted me to get tested for COVID and as long as, excuse me as long as I am doing that, then she wants me to get a general exam, I guess you know."
"10","  Umm.  Yeah, basically, I am just really tired.  I got a stuffed-up nose and a little bit of a cough, but it is not much but the mostly is just sort of the lack of energy and I am tired, I guess I am feeling a little hot.  Well, I used to have a thermometer, but I guess my ex has that.  I do not know, I would ask my girlfriend, maybe she has got one, but anyway I could not measure my temperature, I just kind of felt hot or feel kind of comes and goes, you know."
"11","  It is just right after the last weekend, so I guess it was like maybe last Monday."
"12","  Maybe last weekend, maybe last Sunday, I was beginning to feel it."
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  I did not want to tell you.  I just figured that I just want to make her happy, you know, she says I got to do this, so here I am."
"15","  Yeah."
"16","  Mostly NyQuil or DayQuil.  I got both of them day and night."
"17","  Maybe.  I do not know, maybe.  I feel kind of groggy actually, but I get more sleep this way.  It is kind of hard to sleep first."
"18","  But the NyQuil helps a bit."
"19","  Hmm hmm.  No."
"20","  No, where the guys I work with hang out, but we do not get that close.  I mean, I work in construction, so we are all busy.  We do not just hang around together, you know."
"21","  Umm."
"22","  I just I guess I am qualified in the stuff, but I just have not gotten around to it.  I have not really got that much faith in them that they tell you the truth.  It is."
"23","  That is, I guess why Emily is worried about whether or not she wants me to get tested since I have not had the shots and stuff."
"24","  I think she has had one of them."
"25","  Does that make sense?"
"26","  Yeah, I guess.  So, well, how do I, where do I go to get this test?  Where do I? What do I?  yeah, get and test ________ computer I guess, but."
"27","  Yeah."
"28","   No, sorry.  It is not that personal or anything, but just I never seem to have time for it."
"29","  Yeah, I guess so.  Whatever you know the exam needs."
"30","  Yeah, this is all like covered on my insurance.  You know like I got you know, Premera Blue Cross."
"31","   Okay."
"32","  Yeah."
"33","  Not unless there is anything else you think you should look at or ask about it."
"34","  Okay, great."
"35","  Thanks a lot."
