"1","  Good morning."
"2","  How you’re doing today?"
"3","  All right.  Before we start, my name is Bang, I am a fourth-year medical student at the University of Washington.  Just to confirm, can I get your name too?"
"4","  Is that how you like to be called?"
"5","  Okay.  So, I took a look over your charts and I kind of have an idea of what brought you in today, but can you tell me in your own words, why we’re having this visit today?"
"6","  Yeah.  So, it seems like every four months, but in a little bit longer than that, anything that made it harder for you to come have a visit in the last year or so?"
"7","  Yeah, yeah, it is COVID and life can make things really difficult.  So, it seems like you are here for your diabetes checkup.  Anything else that we should address in this visit?"
"8","  Okay.  Well, I saw in your chart your last A1c was about a 7.9, is that correct?"
"9","  Okay.  We’ll definitely order another A1c to see what your numbers will be today.  Other things, have you had any difficulty taking your medications at all?"
"10","  And then have you been able to take it as prescribed?"
"11","  Okay, all right.  So, most of the time you’re able to take your metformin, but sometimes maybe like often you say you’re not able to take your medication?"
"12","  Okay that you forget once every couple of weeks, so not very frequently that you forget."
"13","  Okay and then you noticed any new side effects with your medications at all?"
"14","  Okay.  So, you feel tired and you’re peeing all the time.  How long has that been going on for?"
"15","  Last month is when it’s getting worse.  When you say peeing all the time, how many times do you think you’re peeing?"
"16","  Okay and then are you peeing a lot every time or is it a little bit?"
"17","  Lots, okay and then you’re also tired all the time?"
"18","  Okay.  Are you able to check your blood sugars at all at home?"
"19","  Okay and then how often are you checking your sugars?"
"20","  And what have your numbers been?"
"21","  Okay."
"22","  200, 250s and then just looking at your old numbers, that seems to be higher than your numbers used to be at.  Just looking at your A1c because that gives us an idea what your sugars normally run at and that seems to be a little bit higher than what it has been.  Has been, you said you are still taking your meds as directed and has there been any changes in your life otherwise that’s affecting you?"
"23","  Okay.  So, you’re still eating pretty much the same as well as before."
"24","  Okay and what kind of foods are you typically eating?"
"25","  Like veggies and meats and/or lots of carb thing."
"26","  Okay, yeah."
"27","  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Freddie, so seems like there is two things that you’re concerned about, one is the diabetes, that been, it’s been a while since your last checkup.  The other thing is this peeing a lot and fatigue that you’re having and feeling tired all the time."
"28","  And it seems to me like these two things are likely linked together.  Yeah from what you’re telling me your diabetes, your sugars are running higher in the 200s and when your sugars run higher, it can make you pee a lot more, I think that’s likely related and then also with your tiredness and fatigue that’s also could be related to your diabetes.  When your sugars run higher definitely that can affect how you’re thinking, how you’re feeling just overall your energy and things like that.  So, I think it’s important that we work on trying to lower your sugars a little bit more back down to where they were before."
"29","  First, what questions do you have for me in regards to the things we just talked about?"
"30","  Yeah.  So, first of all do you have any difficulties scheduling regular appointments with how busy life is, I think we’re going to probably need more frequent appointments rather than this one year long break we had."
"31","  Okay.  I think at least one other things we want to do is we’ll start out more frequent and go out longer as your symptoms are better under control."
"32","  Yeah, we can do telemedicine, it’s not, you don’t have to come in to the office for these things."
"33","  Other things is we do need you to come in once to at least get a blood draw, so we can see what your values are at currently."
"34","  Is that something, are you busy with work and things like that?"
"35","  Well, there should be labs around and you should be able to drop in at your own time.  You don’t have to have a schedule time to come in to our office."
"36","  Okay.  So, we’ll put in the orders for that and then other things, I just want to make sure, are you having any other symptoms issue with your eyes, hearing, chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that?"
"37","  Okay.  Any new abdominal symptoms or pains anywhere else that’s been abnormal for you?"
"38","  Okay.  Any fainting?"
"39","  Okay, all right and there has been no blood in your urine or stools or anything like that?"
"40","  So, seems like otherwise you’re doing pretty well."
"41","  Yeah, being tired and peeing all the time.  I think we can really if we can control your blood sugars, I think that’s something that will improve quite a bit, but we do, we will need some lab tests to make sure you’re doing okay.  So, I was putting the orders for the lab draws and kind of see where your labs are."
"42","  I think, are you interested in talking to a diabetic educator?"
"43","  Okay.  Well something we can do is you know figure out a little bit more, first get your labs. I would like you to work on a few things making sure you are taking your meds all the time as scheduled as prescribed and don’t miss any doses and then other things is I know it’s you like to eat your cheeseburger and good food and things like that, but it would be great if you can cut back a little bit on the carbs, carbohydrates."
"44","  Yeah, yeah.  I think controlling what you eat will be really crucial to controlling your blood sugars.  So, if we can’t, the medicine is only going to go so far and I think it’s important really to control what you eat as well.  Depending on what your next labs show, we may have to increase the dose of your medication or possibly add on another medication, but I think first controlling what you put in, it will be a key step as well because with diabetes when you have a lot of, when you eat a lot of carb things, it raises your blood sugars that’s what we’re controlling and your blood sugars can damage other parts of your body if it’s too high all the time, yeah.  Is that something you’re interested in trying kind of controlling, I can provide with you with some resources on what you should and shouldn’t eat and things you should avoid for that."
"45","  Okay, I mean that’s something we can try as well.  I know it can be very difficult for people to change what they eat.  I eat, it’s hard for me."
"46","  I eat bad as well, but we can that’s something I can send you the resources to take a look at that and things that you should avoid, if you can help it."
"47","  All right, Freddie.  So, I think those are the things we want to work on this time.  I am going to put in a schedule a lab draw for you to check your blood, to check your levels from that I can, I’ll send you another message whether I think we should increase your medication or potentially add on another medication.  I’ll check with the insurance to see what works for you or not and then on your end I’d like you to try to read over these resources for what you can assure or should eat more or less of to try to make yourself more healthy for your sugars, does that sound okay with you?"
"48","  Okay and when is the earliest that you can come in to get your levels drawn?"
"49","  Okay and then I want to make sure you’re not having any pain with urination, is that correct?"
"50","  Okay, no pain, just peeing quite a lot more."
"51","  Actually given your symptoms, it makes me concern that your sugars maybe higher than they should be.  If you don’t mind with checking your sugars as soon as possible and send me, send the numbers to me, your blood sugars and then even before we get your blood draw, we can get a better idea of where your sugars are at right now."
"52","  Then if your sugars are running too high, we may have to do something more urgent, first is waiting out for the labs, okay."
"53","  All right.  So, if you don’t mind just checking your sugars and sending those too me as well.  All right, Freddie, do you have any other questions before I let you go?"
"54","  Okay, all right, Freddie.  Well, we’ll keep in touch, you can always contact me through the MyChart and send me a message and I usually get back pretty fast."
"55","  All right.  Well, all right, Freddie."
"56","  Yeah, we’ll send you, the scheduler should send you another message for try to get another appointment with him and first appointment probably hopefully soon after your labs and then we’ll kind of see where the frequency goes after that, okay."
"57","  All right and take care, Freddie."
