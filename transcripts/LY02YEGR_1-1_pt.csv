"1","  Hey, pretty good.  How are you doing?"
"2","  Yeah.  Thanks for being available so late."
"3","  Oh.  I have been feeling pretty tired, but I figured, you know, I am supposed to, you know, check on my diabetes every four months or so, and it has been about a year and, you know, I want to take care of my health, so here I am."
"4","  Oh.  Well, I did not really like my last provider and so I am looking for a new provider too.  That is one of the things that I wanted to come in for."
"5","  Well, you know, I know I got to take care of my diabetes and everything, but she was just getting out of control demands on my, she wanted me to give up fried chicken on our Sunday get togethers.  It is a family thing and I am not really ready to you know do something quite that, you know drastic I am , I am ready to you know like change my meds and you know, follow the rules and all that stuff but I just did not want to I wanted her to leave my diet alone."
"6","  Yeah, yeah.  The metformin and the glipizide."
"7","  Right. Yeah, a couple of times a day.  Well, most days, I guess I miss a day once every few weeks or so, but pretty much you know on track."
"8","  Hmm hmm.  I think that is up to date.  I need more supplies for doing my testing and you know blood glucose, levels and stuff."
"9","  Uh, do I do that or do you mail them to me? I forget. I think. Oh, maybe it is the pharmacy. Yeah."
"10","  Oh, Okay.  That will be good."
"11","  Oh, I do not know.  It just seems to get progressively worse, maybe it is just, you know, the way things are in the world or the, you know, COVID or all of the things, but it just seems like I am getting slower and slower and just hard to keep up with everybody when you get to be.  Once you reach 60, I think it must be quite a bit a substantial difference for.  Well, anyway, what?"
"12","  I will say the last six months maybe."
"13","  Maybe, yeah."
"14","  This since last Christmas or so.  So that is about six months, right?"
"15","  Umm.  No, I just I would like to sleep, but you know, I got to get up early, so it is just a little later on in the day that I really seemed to run out of steam."
"16","  I think I keep pretty much the same way, it is just.  Well, when I get home from work.  Would back up a little bit during the day  My daughter works and my son-in-law too, but so, my wife Louise takes care of the grandkids and then when I get home, I kind of take over for her and take over the grandkids after I get in and while Louise is making dinner and by the time we are done or we are usually by the time we get ready for dinner and then the kids will show up and grab the grandkids and take them off but that kind of in between time like normally would be right now instead of being here, I would be trying to keep up with three little girls.  And let me tell you, it is not easy."
"17","  8-year-old wants to be mom and the 5-year-old wants to be the 8-year-old and the 2 -year-old takes the whole world just kind of revolves around her anyway.  So it is, let me tell you, it just kind of where is your town after a while?"
"18","  Yeah."
"19","  I've been working to keeping those under 8 you know I know they were getting into the 7s and that was 7 point this and that but I want to definitely keep them below 8.  One thing I do not want to do is end up on insulin."
"20","  Well. I am willing to do that.  It is just really a question of time usually because I have got a real busy schedule at work.  I manage several facilities from the downtown facility and so and then getting home and having all the family commitments, it is like I am not really sure when I can umm, well, I tried to.  Well, I do.  I do a little bit more walking, that is hopefully some exercise too."
"21","  Oh, pretty much, yeah."
"22","  Umm. I do not know what, would it be okay if I just stood up sometimes because finding a different kind of desk that just, I do not know."
"23","  I just could walk in over there.  Yeah, I usually get over to the McDonald's that is nearby, so well, I guess I get that walk anyway.  I mean, that is what I do. I walk over there and get my lunch and bring it back here."
"24","  Yeah, take the long way around. That sounds like a good idea."
"25","  Okay, it is so it sounds like what I need to do then is come in for the test.  Do I come to the?  Which clinic ? Do I come to you?"
"26","  Umm, okay, uh, well, either I am either downtown at work or we own our own home over in Columbia City, so what place should I go?"
"27","  And this is all under premier Blue Cross insurance plan, right?"
"28","  Okay."
"29","  It's called Mirabella."
"30","   Yeah, it is a chain and we have got the downtown facilities and other ones as well.  Yeah. Anyway that I work in the downtown one."
"31","  No, that is where I work.  I do not know."
"32","  I do not know what you're talking about.  Sorry. I guess we are talking about different things."
"33","  Where is this?  Where are you?"
"34","  Okay.  We will work out those details.  If you got the downtown clinic, then that sounds like that will be the place for me to come in and get the testing done.  Is that where I would meet with the physician later for a followup visit or"
"35","  Okay, that sounds great."
"36","  Yeah, that is what I have got over here.  I am doing that right now.  534 15th, right?"
"37","   Okay, great."
"38","  Oh, maybe after work tomorrow? Would that be a?"
"39","  Well, I guess so, yeah, it sounds like a plan."
"40","  I guess this is best but it was kind of like that my dinner off a little while but I guess we can do this in the "
"41","  There we go. Okay, 7"
"42","  Uh.  I do not know.  I am just getting to be an old man and I am gonna die soon or I do not know, I got a lot of questions I guess, but."
"43","  Oh well, that is good.  Anyway, I will do that lab work tomorrow, I guess and then we got that appointment 7"
"44","  21st yeah two weeks.  Okay, great."
"45","  Okay.  Well, thank you and I will figure out which button to push and wait to see you next time."
