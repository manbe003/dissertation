"2","  Yes.  There it is.  I found it.  It's not a real button, but I found it."
"3","  I'm all right, Kate.  How are you?"
"4","  Yeah, that darn, __darn__ to the rush."
"5","  Yeah, that and another one."
"6","  That one, yes."
"7","   I mean so far good.  I just feel like I don't have a lot of energy when I want it. "
"8","  I play with my grandkids, and I get tired and get tired at work.  I get tired with them."
"9","  I've got three children and the daughter has two, the son has one.  One is 8, one is 5, and one is 2."
"10","  A lot of knee rides."
"11","  Just organizing my desk."
"12","  Yeah."
"13","  Or like towards the end of doing things, I want to keep going, but I don't want to keep going."
"14","  Just knee overall."
"15","  Yeah, yeah, it's not been a long time."
"16","  I think it was six months ago.  I got already.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, six months yeah."
"17","  I would say after a little later in the day."
"18","  I just ran out of the little strippy things today."
"19","  Let me see, I wrote it down, 240 blood sugar, yes."
"20","  I don't think so.  No."
"21","  Maybe a little."
"22","  Oh, blood work, I don't know, will it be a few months ago."
"23","  Yeah, we are used to that."
"24","  That's on the wife and probably not.  I like what she cooks because I eat it."
"25","  (Laughs)"
"26","  I work in construction.  I'm a foreman."
"27","  I move from site to site to make sure everything's alright."
"28","  It sounds okay, you know, up and down, but the season is getting there."
"29","  For the job?"
"30","  This is overall, is a lot of fire putting out.  I put out fires almost literal fire sometimes, but"
"31","  Yeah.  Oh, whoa. No.  It's dangerous.  It's not a playground, but we somehow always are playing around.  I don't know."
"32","  I think it comes from when we were boys playing with trucks.  Itâ€™s since that."
"33","  You know we get $100 an hour and play with trucks in the dirt.  Think of us."
"34","  Yeah.  And how's your sleep been?  Have you been able to kind of turn your brain off at night?"
"35","  The kids help me, yeah."
"36","  You know, I wouldn't know.  You all have way different conversations than we do."
"37","  I mean, she might tell you I'm okay and I complain a lot."
"38","   She made me come do this."
"39","  Yeah, right."
"40","  I'm here so I don't get fine."
"41","  Or die."
"42","  Yeah."
"43","  Just tired.  I get a little like not numb in my legs, but just feels like something's on. How about that?"
"44","  Yes."
"45","  But not like shock, but just like it would be before the shocks happen."
"46","  That's where the shock goes."
"47","  Say, it's pretty nominal."
"48","  Like having to catch my balance, maybe. yeah."
"49","  Oh, no."
"50","  Sometimes, maybe once in a couple of weeks or something."
"51","  No."
"52","  No, I'm pretty, you know, I kind of, you know, I'm rough on work, but everything is still. I don't feel nothing tender right now. "
"53","  No, no, I wouldn't say so."
"54","  Yeah, I take, I kind of try not to. I try to, but yeah, I'll get up there if, you know, I got to get an elevator.  I gotta go to a floor or something, but yeah."
"55","  Uh, just don't really have to."
"56","   Yeah, I guess someone.  It's more of like a delegating kind of thing.  I'm just like a foreman.  I got the white hat on."
"57","  Try to put a ring on your finger with one hand."
"58","  That's delegating."
"59","  I would say twice a day, every other day."
"60","  Twice a day."
"61","  I gotta have a, you know that morning, take that thing, I forget because I just get up, get ready to go, grab the coffee, I'm out the house."
"62","  Hmm, hmm."
"63","  Maybe like once a week?"
"64","  You know, maybe I ate too much, I think or something, but yeah, like once a week."
"65","  That sounds easier."
"66","  Less cognitively cumbersome."
"67","  Yeah, 142, I don't know what is the number, I wrote it down somewhere, I took that."
"68","  Yes."
"69","  7.4 they say keep it under, under but not under, under.  (Laughs)"
"70","  I see.  Make the window for the body of the process."
"71","  Gotcha."
"72","  Make my medicine fit my mind."
"73","  My lifestyle? Gosh."
"74","  Yeah, that sounds great."
"75","  Call the wife and make sure she tells me, how about that?  I mean."
"76","  Yes."
"77","  Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"78","  Probably every other day.  I didn't do it today."
"79","   I ran out of the things."
"80","  Oh."
"81","  In the morning."
"82","  Oh, okay, that sounds doable.  Yeah, okay."
"83","  That's another way of thinking of it, yes."
"84","  Okay.  I can, I'll work on this, yes."
"85","  That sounds great."
"86","  Yeah.  And I need to pay more attention to things."
"87","  Concerning my body, yes."
"88","  It's fine."
"89","  (Laughs)"
"90","  I actually just made one for two weeks from now.  I need to get some more glasses."
"91","  ________ the better friend."
"92","  Okay."
"93","  Okay."
"94","  Okay."
"95","  Stick in the morning, stick at night."
"96","  That sounds great."
"97","  You gave me enough information.  No, I am full.  Thank you."
"98","  Well, I thank you and thank you for your efforts and your education."
"99","  Yes.  Very good."
"100","  Okay, I'll expect it."
"101","  You as well.  Thank you."
"102","  I gotta hit the buttons.  Seeing these buttons?  Oh my God.  Where?  Oh see, they don't even show up.  How do you like disappear?  Wait that one.  There you go."
"103","  You're still there.  All you got to do it again."
