"1","  Is that, can you hear me?"
"2","  Great, okay.  Sorry, this isn’t my normal computer, I don’t know where the mouse is, I got to use this weird touch mouse thing that they have and well anyway, here I am and ready to go.  What do you need to know?"
"3","  Yeah, it’s just Freddy Jones.  There is no frills attached or anything like that."
"4","  Freddy after people get to know me, unless they don’t like me and then it’s Mr. Jones, I guess, but."
"5","  Yeh, the day after Valentine's Day, 1962, and its 15; missed it by a day but."
"6","  What my gender?  Just male, I mean."
"7","  What you mean, where I am taking it from?  You mean it by insurance?"
"8","  I am at home, but I have to get a computer from work to talk to you that's why it’s kind of new to me here, but looks like we got it under control now."
"9","  Nah, not right now, no."
"10","  I am afraid if kids around here.  I got 3 grandkids and my kids and my wife, they are around here somewhere.  Hopefully, they won’t be making too much noise while we are talking."
"11","  Oh, yeah."
"12","  Yeah, I know that I am supposed to come in about every four months or so and check on my diabetes, but I have been so busy and stuff, I haven’t been for about a year or so, you know, I want to take care of my health and so here I am."
"13","  That’s the main thing, I want to, I mean if we need to adjust my meds, that’s okay.  I am."
"14","  So we can talk about that."
"15","  Yeah, yes, as a matter of fact."
"16","  Well, it’s just kind of been this year, I guess, especially last few months.  Just don’t seem to have the energy level, especially later on in the afternoon and run out of gas, it is a worry."
"17","  Kind of both.  I just like get no energy and I really like to take a nap, but sometimes you can't do that, you know.  Just got to go on with what you got to go on with."
"18","  No, not really."
"19","  Yeah."
"20","  I don’t like to give it a lot of thought and I just can't think of any.  No."
"21","  Oh yeah, I do that twice a week.  In fact, I did that this morning and it was about 215."
"22","  Well, may be yeah.  Pardon me."
"23","  Jesus there is pollen in the air when it gets you.  Anyway, what was the question?"
"24","  Oh yeah, yeah, it’s usually about 200."
"25","  Right, I do that before breakfast."
"26","  Right."
"27","  What a low blood sugar would be?"
"28","  Oh, goal.  I don’t know.  I try to keep it about 200, I guess.  Is that a good round number."
"29","  Oh wow."
"30","  Okay, sounds good."
"31","  I take metformin twice a day, that is 500 mg pills and a glipizide once a day and let’s see, but I keep seeing on TV, that all the things that you are talking about Ozempic and I can't even remember the names of them all, but they are all saying talk to your doctor about this and this is for diabetes and talk to your doctor about that and so I was thinking that you know may be adjusting my meds would be the best way to get on top of the diabetes, you know."
"32","  Yeah."
"33","  Not for a while.  Last time I checked it, it was below 8 and so that is basically my goal is keeping it below 8, so."
"34","  I guess, is that about a year ago?"
"35","  Yeah, I guess it was about a year ago."
"36","  Yeah, is that the last time I, yeah, I haven’t been in for a while.  Sorry about that, but it’s about a year ago, I guess."
"37","  Okay.  I am just a little worried about, you know, going out in public.  You know, we still wear masks and at work in our facility is there is also most part, so, and I understand from the TV that there is a whole new round of COVID is coming now, but we have had our shots but I don’t know about, especially with the kids, you know.  They are so young.  What’s the youngest they can get it? because we got an 8, a 5, and a 2-year-old that, and you know I don’t want them catching anything either, so."
"38","  Oh okay, good.  That good, but then."
"39","  Yeah, I will talk to my son-in-law and daughter.  So that’s good news.  That will take care of them."
"40","  Not too much, may be once every couple of weeks.  I am pretty careful about it, most of the time."
"41","  Oh, I have them set up for morning and evening routine so, if it’s evening and it’s still there, I haven’t taken it yet and if its morning and its still there, then I have to take it, so."
"42","  Yeah."
"43","  Nothing I recall, no."
"44","  Oh yeah, that makes sense."
"45","  Not for a while.  I don’t know.  I have been doing this for about eight years now, so, yeah."
"46","  Oh, okay."
"47","  But I only take the glipizide once."
"48","  No, I just do it the one time and I take the metformin twice, at least that is the way I understand it.  Am I doing it wrong?  Is that?"
"49","  Well, that could change everything then.  Yeah."
"50","  Okay, yeah, that sounds good to me."
"51","  I am going to take the glipizide twice a day instead of once a day and then what is it.  Next Saturday I am coming in to get my A1c numbers checked and so, that’s, I think that’s it, yeah."
"52","  Okay, yeah."
"53","  Okay."
"54","  Yeah, I generally keep a log of that.  I think I took it in to work with me and left it there and still leaving it here at home, so I don’t know what it says right now but yeah, I keep a log of that and so, I will keep those notes for you."
"55","  Hmmm.  Okay."
"56","  No, I am just glad you didn't go off to deep down like my last provider did that’s one of the reasons I have changed to you guys is the last one I talked to, wanted me to give up fried chicken.  That means this is all more reasonable, you know, keeping track of the meds and I am hoping this will work out well."
"57","  Yeah, I am fortunate my wife is such a good cook and so I got you know dinner waiting for me every day."
"58","  Yeah, well fried chicken is only once a week and it’s kind of a family get together you know, so it’s not like I am eating three or four chickens for myself.  I am just having a normal piece of this or that and it’s just being pretty outrageous to me."
"59","  Peripheral, no."
"60","  That sounds good, I don’t want that, no."
"61","  No.  Tell me how do you check that, I mean.  I can feel my feet."
"62","  Okie-dookie.  Yeah, I can just picture myself poking myself on the feet with a stick, it’s kind of funny."
"63","  Yeah, okay.  And I would like so.  I haven’t noticed any."
"64","  Okay."
"65","  Okie-dookie.  Sounds like my _____"
"66","  I guess, no, that sounds good."
"67","  You too.  You have a good day now."
"68","  Bye.  I don’t know what to do next.  What do I do here, this mouse thing.  There are the controls."
"69","  Yeh, it’s part of it, that’s gone, Oops."
