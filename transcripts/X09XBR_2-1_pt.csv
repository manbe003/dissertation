"1","  Hi, there."
"2","  Yes."
"3","  Good."
"4","  Well, I’m a little concerned about my diabetes.  I haven’t had any generals, I’m supposed to go like every six months but I’m kind of shop around for a new doctor.  My old doctor kind of made a crack about me and not being made to eat fried chicken anymore.  So, I kind of maybe a little mad, so I stopped going, but right now I’m getting real, I am getting tired easily you know.  So, I am thinking that maybe I should check on my diabetes."
"5","  Yes."
"6","  I guess I have got a problem in my blood sugar and so sometimes I get I have to take my meds pretty regular basis to keep it under control and they said they told me that you can get fatigued easy and that you know you can pee a lot, that I do and I’m just sort of worried about my energy levels, I guess.  Now, I don’t know whether the energy levels with my diabetes get worse or I’m just getting older or what."
"7","  Okay."
"8","  Okay."
"9","  I pee a lot, but I haven’t really noticed much of anything else."
"10","  Oh, Boy!  I don’t know I’m going to say about maybe six times, seven times, you know it depends you know."
"11","  Well, I still am doing that, I noticed that when right before I got diagnosed because I thought it might be the prostate or something."
"12","  Eight years ago."
"13","  A little bit, little bit.  I haven’t been keeping track of you know numbers, but it just seems like I have been going well."
"14","  Can be, yeah, yeah."
"15","  Right."
"16","  Well, the glipizide, I only take that once a day."
"17","  I take one pill generally in the morning and the metformin, I take twice a day."
"18","  I’m pretty good about it.  Now, I will see that at some time maybe every two weeks or so, I might forget a day when something goes haywire at work."
"19","  No."
"20","  No, I just started exercising on a regular basis.  My wife and I go out for a short walk maybe you know twice a week now."
"21","  Yeah, it’s nice, I like it."
"22","  Oh yeah.  I work for a retirement home.  My official title is homecare coordinator, but basically if anything goes wrong, I’m the first one to know about it, okay."
"23","  I sleep about, I don’t know, I guess about six to seven hours a night."
"24","  I generally feel pretty good in the morning.  Sometimes, I have to get up and pee in the night."
"25","  But go fall back sleep pretty easily."
"26","  I haven’t been, no I haven’t been looking at it."
"27","  They’re not you know I haven’t noticed."
"28","  Every so once in a while I got a scale downstairs."
"29","  About the same really."

"35","  First thing in the morning before I eat anything."
"36","  They’ve been kind of between like 130 and 200, I guess."
"37","  Well, it’s get well recently they have been more towards the 200 end."
"38","  Okay, that makes sense."
"39","  Yeah, I got to figure, I got to work around my job."
"40","  Because this is pretty demanding.  I am pretty much the guy actually I said if anything goes wrong, I’m the first guy to know about it."
"41","  I got to kind of figure out the time to actually get and make room for that."
"42","  Okay."
"43","  Okay.  I am curious about what it seems like some like side effects that can kind of mess me up if I increase the dosage you know."
"44","  Okay, okay."
"45","  Yeah, I guess so, I guess, yeah you know it might mess with my stomach."
"46","  You kind of get used to it _______________."
"47","  Okay."
"48","  Yeah."
"49","  Okay, yeah.  I don’t want to get a whole cocktail because I got and I know some people at work I mean they’re just on this, they are just so drugged out occasionally that they just I don’t know, what the, I don’t know what the thing is but it’s just it’s sad to see."
"50","  Yeah."
"51","  I see, okay."
"52","  Yes, as long as you know I’m keeping off insulin, yeah."
"53","  I don’t want to go down that route."
"54","  Okay."
"55","  Oh no, not at all."
"56","  Yeah, okay."
"57","  Yeah, yeah."
"58","  Yeah, so I can do two in the morning or two at night or whatever, okay."
"59","  Okay, okay."
"60","  That seems doable and I can keep up with the walks and stuff."
"61","  Okay, okay."
"62","  That’s pretty much what I’m concerned with."
"63","  Okay."
"64","  Great."
"65","  Bye now."
