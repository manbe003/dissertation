"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Good.  How are you? Are you Mr. Johnson?"
"3","  I am doing well.  I am Sangita.  I am the medical provider who is going to be seeing you for this visit."
"4","  Yeah, what do you prefer I call you?"
"5","  Okay, alright.  Okay, so let’s just start right in.  Can you tell me a little bit about what’s bringing you in today to see us?"
"6","  Okay, okay.  And how long have you been having these symptoms?"
"7","  Two weeks, okay.  And what exactly are you experiencing?"
"8","  Okay, okay.  Any fevers at all?"
"9","  Feeling kind of hot, okay.  Have you checked your temperature or you just feel, you feel like maybe you felt a little feverish?"
"10","  Alright.  And have you had like any runny nose, any drip or anything?"
"11","  No, okay.  Alright and have you had any like shortness of breath at all, difficulty breathing?"
"12","  Feeling tired, okay.  And has your cough been like about the same that started two weeks ago, has been getting better or has been getting worse?"
"13","  Okay, okay.  Does the DayQuil help your cough, does it make you feel better or….?"
"14","  Helps a little bit, okay.  Alright and then any like loss of taste or smell at all?"
"15","  No, okay, okay.  Alright and are you coughing up any blood, have you noticed that at all?"
"16","  Okay, alright.  And anyone else around you who is sick or been sick recently?"
"17","  Hello?  You are frozen on my screen Tom.  Might be my Wi-Fi or.  Tom?"
"18","  Yes, hello, sorry about that.  I think I had been asking if anyone else around you has been sick at all?"
"19","  Okay, okay, alright, okay.  And have you had COVID before?"
"20","  No, okay.  And have you been vaccinated for COVID?"
"21","  Okay, is it getting vaccinated?"
"22","  Okay, okay, alright.  Okay, well have you been having like any chest pain at all?"
"23","  Okay and then I am just going to run through like just some other symptoms just to make sure that I am not missing anything, but have you had any like night sweats, any weight loss recently?"
"24","  Okay, any like nausea, vomiting, stomach pain?"
"25","  Okay, any issues like with your bowel movements or with urinating at all?"
"26","  Okay.  You have diarrhea once a week and how long has that been going on, right now you mentioned quite some time?"
"27","  A few years okay, okay, okay.  And have you ever been evaluated for that or…?"
"28","  In over 10 years, okay, okay.  Alright, okay, and then any like muscle aches or pains?"
"29","  And any headaches, dizziness at all?"
"30","  Okay, good.  Alright, well it certainly sounds to me like you could have some kind of viral illness.  Two weeks is a little long, but sometimes the cough takes longer to get better.  So I definitely think that starting with the COVID test is very reasonable.  You had mentioned that – how do you feel about that, about getting, I know you kind of mentioned that your girlfriend has been pressuring you."
"31","  Yeah, I think that’s a great idea.  You had mentioned that you hadn’t been to the doctor in a while.  Do you have any other medical conditions, any history of any medical conditions?"
"32","  Do you take any other medications regularly?"
"33","  Okay, okay and have you ever been hospitalized?"
"34","  Okay, okay.  Alright and any family history of any medical conditions?"
"35","  Okay, okay, alright, okay and do you smoke at all sir?"
"36","  Okay and how much do you smoke on average?"
"37","  Okay, alright.  Do you drink alcohol at all?"
"38","  Alright.  Okay and any like recreational drug use, any marijuana or VI drugs?"
"39","  Okay, okay, good.  Alright, well to me it sounds like you know this is most likely like l mentioned like a viral illness, I definitely think that we can get you tested for COVID, it can be that, you know it’s some other viral infection, it is the season for it certainly and it might take some time just to get better.  How bothersome is your cough, would you like to try some medication for it or..?"
"40","  Yeah, sure.  We can."
"41","  Yeah, yeah, so definitely the test will help us kind of figure out if it is COVID or not and so we can see what that shows.  I can definitely order that for you and then if it is not COVID, it’s most likely some other viral infection, so I think that giving it some time is really important and I can just like, we have something called Tessalon Perles which can kind of help with the cough when it is troublesome for you, certainly like harmless, and don’t really have any other side effects so that’s an option that we can, we can try."
"42","  Get you tested for COVID and then of course you had mentioned that you haven’t been to the doctor in a while and so I just want to ask there is obviously like some routine like health maintenance things that we like to check, you are you know you are 58 years old, at that age we usually recommend like colon cancer prescreening and some other things that are just kind of routine and I just want to kind of gauge like what’s your level of interest of doing some of those things, would you be willing to do that since you are here today and we can kind of get some things rolling if that interests you?"
"43","  Okay. "
"44","  Sure that’s very reasonable and so we can get that test for you and lastly I kind of want to address is you know COVID vaccination.  You had mentioned kind of that you hadn’t decided about that and so I just wanted to ask you like what are some of your hesitations about the vaccine?"
"45","  Okay."
"46","  Sure okay, so maybe just some uncertainly about how the vaccine will affect people long term is what I am hearing?"
"47","  Okay, alright, that’s very reasonable you know we obviously like encourage everyone to get vaccinated, it’s you know it has been tested and it is obviously very effective and COVID can be pretty devastating and we definitely want to make sure that’s if you are able to get vaccinated we encourage it and we recommend it but just wanted to put that thought in your ear, but let’s go ahead get that COVID test and then maybe talk about next steps once we have those results."
"48","  Okay, I’ll put that order in and we’ll get that going.  Do you have any other questions that you had that I haven’t addressed yet?"
"49","  Okay, alright, it was a pleasure meeting you Tom."
"50","  I’ll be in touch, yeah, no problem."
"51","  Bye."
