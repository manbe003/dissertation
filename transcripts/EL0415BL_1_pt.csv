"1","  Just, do it there."
"2","  Hi Hadley, how are you doing?"
"3","  Umm, I am okay.  I have been better, but not too bad."
"4","  Yeah.  There we go."
"5","  The light on the top there.  Yeah, I've, I don't, I am not worried.  My girlfriend told me I had to come in.  I think I just have a cold.  But she, she says that I need to get checked for COVID.  And as long as I am here, I should get a general exam because I have not done that for a while."
"6","  Then, about five days I guess, since Monday just feeling you know that stopped feeling of a cold and stuff and my throat is a little bit itchy.  And so, I cough a little bit, but it's not too bad.  It is not as bad as she thinks it is."
"7","  (Laughs) Okay, well, she's just you know, looking out for you.  I am sure."
"8","  ________ yeah."
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Right."
"11","  No."
"12","  This sort of, you know, kind of clearish, sort of mucus stuff, you know, a sort of whitish yellow, may be."
"13","  Something like that."
"14","  No."
"15","  I work in construction.  So I kind of like start at the beginning of the day and then finish at the end of the day, so..."
"16","  I have been really tired.  It is kind of wearing me out.  I have been sleeping more and feeling kind of down this week."
"17","  But I mean, not enough to interfere with the job or whatever but.."
"18","  Yeah."
"19","  No.  nothing I can think of."
"20","  I have been feeling kind of hot, I do not know.  I cannot, I used to have a thermometer.  I do not know what happened to it, I think my ex wife has it, but anyway, I just feel kind of warm.  You know?"
"21","  Yeah."
"22","  No, nothing like.  It is kind of a warm clammy feeling sometime?"
"23","  No."
"24","  No."
"25","  No."
"26","   Nothing new I mean, I get muscle aches all the time."
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Yeah."
"29","  Actually, I get diarrhea once in a while, every couple of weeks I guess, but no nausea or anything like that."
"30","  I have had that for a while.  Two to three years, I guess."
"31","  I hope not.  I do not think so.  We are pretty careful at work to wear masks and keep our distance.  We are busy anyways."
"32","  Yeah."
"33","  No, I, I am going to just kind of wait and see how it works out.  I am not big on doctors and vaccines and stuff."
"34","  Um, again, if I have to, I mean my girlfriend got them and she keeps yelling at me about it, but maybe if it makes her happy, but I do not see much point to it frankly."
"35","  Pardon me."
"36","  No, I just do not have much faith in it, I guess."
"37","  Yeah, I have been taking DayQuil and Nyquil."
"38","  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, help me to sleep and keep me at work."
"39","  Umm, keeping my nose running and helping me sleep."
"40","  Knock on wood. It is. Yeah, I am hoping so."
"41","  I am sorry.  No, I do not take any.  No."
"42","  About 10 years ago, maybe."
"43","  Nothing else I can think of, no."
"44","   Um, I like bike riding, you know as much as I used to, but a couple of times a week at least.  And, and my girlfriend and I like to go hiking every once in a while, taken over, you know on the weekends."
"45","  Not regularly no.  I tried it when I was a kid, maybe."
"46","  I do not know dinner time, I just have a few beers.  That is about it."
"47","  Umm, I do not really like it out of cans.  I like it better out of bottles, but I would say about three, maybe three or four."
"48","  No, no, I keep a pretty steady diet."
"49","  No, it gives me energy to burn off I guess, so, it used to work out a bit."
"50","  No, no, I haven't."
"51","  Um, well, not anymore.  Yeah, my mom had breast cancer, but then she survived that, but then, she died a couple of years ago."
"52","  My dad, I do not know.  Oh, my grandpa had colon cancer.  I think it was colon cancer long time ago, I do not know when, I forgot.  I was a kid."
"53","  Is anybody interested in that?  I guess you know, if I gotta but like I said, I do not have too much faith in all this, but I keep telling Emily, my girlfriend that it is just a cold and she does not have to worry with."
"54","  I guess not, go ahead, yeah, sure."
"55","  I am not really."
"56","  Well, I guess we got to look and see what's, what's what and..."
"57","  Okay."
"58","  Yeah."
"59","  I guess so. We get to process, yeah."
"60","  Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
"61","  Sounds like a plan."
"62","  I cannot think of anything.  Is there anything else you think we should look at?"
"63","  All right."
"64","  Okay, well, I appreciate your help, Hadley."
"65","  You too."
"66","  I think I found that red button there.  There we go."
