"1","  Camera on and start.  There is a like a little kind of almost camcorder looking thing in the corner.  Here we go and then a yeah, if you just want to hit your little mike button, there is like a little thing to the left to that camera, then I can hear you.  Do you see it, it is like to the left.  There we go."
"2","  I can hear you now."
"3","  I know, can be tricky sometimes, huh?  Well, thanks for hopping on with me.  I appreciate it.  How are you doing today Freddie?"
"4","  Okay, yeah.  Now, I was reading about that a little bit.  I was going to ask you about that, so you’ve been tired for about six months now and it’s a little bit hard to stand and move around and what not.  Could you explain a little bit more about what that’s like or maybe what it feels like?"
"5","  Yeah, definitely, definitely.  And I know you said that, you know, that you are supposed to come in and stuff like that and sometimes life could be crazy.  COVID was definitely a crazy time."
"6","  And still is definitely to a degree and stuff and so, could you maybe explain to like what stopped you from coming in?"
"7","  Yeah, no definitely, that’s a bummer, and I just have a niece and what not, and so I can totally get that.  Sometimes after a busy weekend or if I kind of exhaust myself a little bit too much, then I am out of it, yeah the rest evening and they run around like crazy, they are ready I guess though."
"8","  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Oh yeah, we can talk a little bit more about that too and hopefully we can maybe get something like ease of appointment setting and stuff like that in your schedule, then hopefully we can clear up some of these issues and then get you back on track to feeling a little bit better, so that you can hang out with your grandkids more, if that’s your main goal."
"9","  Awesome, yeah.  So we're just going to start by talking about what brought you in today and then that’s going to segue way into kind of like a big review that I like to do getting a feel for your family history, your social history, and then even then diving a little bit into your social and stuff, you tell more about your grandkids and then that will go into kind of like a plan that we decide together and discuss and talk about.  Does that sound alright?"
"10","  Hahaha."
"11","  Oh, my gosh!"
"12","  Oh, well I wanted to be older a couple of times, now I might regret it a little.  That’s funny, too cute.  So just getting a little bit into what is bringing you in.  I mean you describe having a little bit hard time walking around or feeling fatigued or just if there is any specific pain you can know in any region if it is like your legs, your arms, chest?"
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  Yeah, definitely."
"15","  Yeah and when you talk about this, the pain that you had in the past, have you noticed diabetics sometimes can be prone to experiencing like neuropathy and foot ulceration just because sensation can kind of go away sometimes.  Have you had anyone like look at your feet whether it be like your family, your grandkids and has anybody noticed anything?"
"16","  That’s okay."
"17","  Yeah.  Would you say that there may be, they were numb a little bit before they were feeling better before and now they are just super, they just hurt a lot when you are moving around?"
"18","  Ok."
"19","  Yeah, now that’s great, that’s great, definitely good to push yourself and what not and keep staying active, but I know it.  Stop it when you are not feeling so good, especially when walking around and being on your feet when it hurts.  So yeah, we will definitely try to get that taken care of.  So a couple of things, just to kind of go over as a big review of systems again.  This is the part that I mentioned I am going to ask you series of questions.  Maybe like your 8-year-old niece is boss and then you could just tell me kind of what you feel too."
"20","  Alright.  So just starting off with family history, is there anything you have noticed with them, your kiddoes assuming that you did have them by child birth and they are not adoptive, that they have had come up in their lives medically, or anything in your parents, siblings?"
"21","  Sorry to hear that."
"22","  Okay and do you know if your mom was a type 1 or type 2 diabetic?"
"23","  Type 2?  Okay, okay.  Alright.  And then kind of moving on a little bit to the next section, that one is a little bit quicker, your meds and allergies, I just have metformin and the glipizide.  Do you take anything over-the-counter or are there any substances that you use that are not prescribed?"
"24","  Okay, okay, no that sounds good, alright.  Do you have any allergies to anything that have come up lately, including seasonal allergies or anything like that?"
"25","  Okay, alright.  And then just a couple of other things, big general questions, I am a little bit curious about like review of systems and just kind of getting a feel for your overall health, if it is like some generalized fatigue sometimes we can ask a bunch of questions and I can know when like, well I mean it is coming from here, or here, here.  So we will look at doing a little bit of that, okay?"
"26","  Cool.  So have you noticed any like fever or chills or anything like that lately?"
"27","  Okay.  Any weight gain or weight loss?"
"28","  Alright.  And then have you had any, yeah excuse me don’t type, have you had any unexplained like changes in your hand or skin or anything like that?"
"29","  Okay, alright, good.  Have you…"
"30","  Yeah, there you go, it’s a plus, that’s a plus.  Have you noticed any changes with your vision or your hearing?"
"31","  Alright, and then have you noticed any changes within your mouth or swallowing, sore throat?"
"32","  Alright.  Sinuses, lymph nodes, anything like that that have popped up?"
"33","  Okay, okay.  And then anything in regard to your tummy, like any abdominal pain or anything like that?"
"34","  Alright.  Trouble breathing, anything along those lines, chest pain?"
"35","  Okay.  Generalized muscle weakness?"
"36","  Yeah, definitely."
"37","  Yeah, okay.  No, that makes sense things for explaining a little bit more.  And then have you felt any weird sensation like does everything feel the same on both sides of your body, have you noticed anything along those lines?"
"38","  No, that’s okay.  I am left-handed.  I totally hear you.  Hahaha.  Alright.  And then the last couple of questions, like anything that has changed in regard to your like urinary cycles or any like defecating incontinence, trouble pooping, anything like that?"
"39","  Okay.  And then this one is a little bit hard, because not everyone knows their labs all the time, but have you noticed any endocrinological changes, whether that’s with, oh gosh like potassium, sodium, water intake, lots of salt, little salt, has any of that come up lately or anybody mentioned these things to you?"
"40","  Not really."
"41","  Yeah, yeah."
"42","  Oh, you are all good."
"43","  Yeah.  No, that definitely makes sense.  I will actually circle back to some of those questions and ask you just pop into your health-related behaviors and stuff.  So starting with if you have a primary care provider that you see regularly?"
"44","  Sunday dinners?"
"45","  Okay, we can talk a little bit more about that and yeah I would be happy to put that on my list, meet PCP, things that we can, put together for you after the fact.  And just given that is there anyone that you see for our dentistry work or anything along those lines, someone you go to regularly?"
"46","  Good, okay good.  That was another thing I was going to get you to is do you feel like you have good coverage and stuff and do you think it that way?"
"47","  Got you, yeah.  No definitely that makes sense.  Thanks for explaining a little bit more.  I think too that once you get into a PCP, then we can know some more, more of those answers about how ______."
"48","  Oh a primary care provider, some you see regularly like a doctor."
"49","  Yeah, yeah."
"50","  Glad you said that I could catch myself saying it, not everyone is like, on that same lingo, so that makes sense."
"51","  I know it’s crazy.  My uncle still uses a pager, he is yet to hop on a cellphone kind, so he is one of the few.  Hopping into a couple more questions, do you tend to wear a seatbelt when you are driving and what not?"
"52","  Okay.  And are there any…"
"53","  Yeah, yeah, that’s necessary health-related behaviors we like to see how you view safety in regard to yourself. And so yes, we got doctors, dentists, you wear a seatbelt.  Do you have firearms in the home?"
"54","  Okay, okay.  And then would you say that you eat again like a pretty healthy diet if you wanted to describe that to me, that’s not part of it."
"55","  Yeah, that’s awesome and what are some of the foods that you like to eat that you consider healthy?"
"56","  Yeah."
"57","  Got you, okay, okay.  And for dinners and stuff?"
"58","  Yeah, no definitely.  I think a lot of that will be helpful in helping me establish as to why we are here in today and maybe why you are experiencing some fatigue and we can maybe make some connections a little bit down the line, but that’s really helpful, thank you.  Would you be okay describing your exercise?  I know you said you’ve not been ___ but you’ve been getting on some walks and stuff, how many hours a week would you say or how many minutes?"
"59","  Okay."
"60","  Definitely."
"61","  Yeah."
"62","  Yeah, Yeah, very pretty.  Yeah, I have not been down there, but I would love to at some point, I have heard good things in the past, so that would be really cool at some point.  Alright.  Another couple of things that I am just going to ask you, just about your social history and stuff.  This is the fun part I was hoping to get to.  This is just going to be places of support, maybe a little bit of your upbringing, what you do for work and that kind of stuff.  So wherever you for comfortable starting about your social life, just feel free to explain away."
"63","  Yeah."
"64","  Oh okay."
"65","  Yeah, that’s nice of you guys.  That’s exercise too.  I am going to count that in."
"66","  Yeah.  So just kind of rounding out a little bit, you are busy, I know I have held you for quite some time today.  Number one, I appreciate you for being with me and two, I do want you to keep up with these meetings regularly because those can be really helpful in terms of maintaining your care, so you can keep doing the things you want.  So even if this is what like 15, 20, to 30 minutes, if this is every six months or so, then that can save you all that fatigue and energy sometimes if you just are you know on top of those meetings and stuff you can catch things and see things and put pieces together that are helpful."
"67","  Yeah.  So a couple ideas that I have.  Number one, being start locating your PCP that you feel comfortable with, I mean discussing things with, potentially looking at some foot care options and what not too, and making sure that your feet are all good, like I said.  So that’s a couple of things can like go away or come about with diabetes, it is a really complex disease and so things like assessing your feet, your eyes, and then a few other bodily parts that are connected are really important and so seeing someone regularly for those would be helpful.  And then…"
"68","  I know, kind of goofy.  The body is kind of funny that way, yeah.  But aside from that, I did want to have kind of a discussion just about diabetes is a disease and just kind of talk about what you know about it, what’s your familiarity with type 2 diabetes?  Do you know how it sometimes comes about?  Do you know what can induce it or anything like that?"
"69","  Yeah."
"70","  Yeah, definitely, definitely and I think that those medications are really big and crucial in terms of helping people.  What we are taught about in school and what I learned a lot of is that there is a combination between medication and then also lifestyle and so when I was asking you those questions a little bit about your lifestyle, the diet, the exercise, PCP, that kind of gives me a good picture to see what maybe we could help you with on that side too, because like I said there is almost like a two-part system.  So a little bit of insight into type 1 diabetes and type 2.  Type 1 tends from about just through autoimmune measures and they kind of come out of nowhere, sometimes it’s within family trees and whatnot and they can come about just kind of extraneous and random ways and it’s where your body stops making something that helps you break down fats and whatnot so that you can absorb it properly and can lead a healthy life that way.  And diabetes 2 is similar, or type 2 diabetes is similar in the sense that you do develop insulin resistance over time and in a similar capacity you can stop having the ability to break down and process food in a way that keeps you healthy and well.  And so in describing type 2, this one tends to come about in terms of sometimes diet, exercise, the things that you do, and so while we can maintain part of it with medication and the other part that we maintain is with the diet and exercise, and I wonder if this is what may be your past PCP was trying to get at in terms of like food and just being mindful of it and whatnot, but something that we see that tends to be really helpful in maintaining type 2 diabetes can just be the food we consume, the things we do to move around and whatnot and that can lead to a healthier outcome and lifestyle.  Does that make sense so far what I have said?"
"71","  Definitely, yeah.  And I hear what you are saying too.  It’s hard to give up good food, me being away at school for so long, I would sometimes kill for a home cooked meal and stuff like that.  And sometimes it is hard to come by.  I think that a lot of the foods that you might, wife is making are really rich in certain aspects of what you need in your daily diet, some things might not be as good for you.  Some things like Coca-Cola frequently or McDonald's just from a couple that you mentioned in even like eating ice-cream every so often, that can sometimes weigh on your body a little bit over time.  And so I know that, while you said your wife is a great cook, if you would consider maybe carving some of those things out and I hope you don't take offense to me, and I hope you know I am trying to ___ of helping you reach your goals, one being that one of your goals is that you don’t want to be on insulin and this could be something that comes about.  "
"72","  Yeah, later on and number two, that you want to spend more time with your grandkids.  These are all things like I said to this two-part process of one part drugs and one part having those lifestyle changes that could really be helpful.  So if you would be interested, I think they will explain some of those with a PCP through some longstanding appointments and talking through stuff might be really good."
"73","  Yeah.  And they can hopefully talk to you about it in way more knowledgeable than I can about the nutritional aspect of things, so that you can still keep that good cooking, but maybe instead of, oh gosh, certain oils, you use olive oil because that’s a certain type of good fat and things like that, that can be maybe helpful, but still taste the same."
"74","  Yeah."
"75","  Definitely."
"76","  Yeah.  But some things taste good too that might be a little bit better like sometimes sparkling water is a good substitute, with like a little less sugar and I know it doesn’t taste the same, but even like juice instead."
"77","  Oh, that’s an interesting reaction, yeah.  No totally.  I think that again having a meeting with another provider to like kind of followup on more of those things, potentially a nutritionist to help out and maybe even your wife, you said Louise."
"78","  Yeah, maybe she could attend some of those appointments with you and both of you could talk through that so that it does not impact her cooking too much, because I am sure that is what she loves to do and doesn’t want to ______."
"79","  Yeah."
"80","  Oh what help they will be."
"81","  Yeah, I hope they will be too much not more compromise, but that makes sense."
"82","  No, no, not my intention at all, just to keep you healthy and help you reach your goals.  Alright, well from what I mentioned so far the ideas again that I have for you just to kind of summarize being let us get you to a PCP, a new one, who will review and kind of go more in depth over the things that you need in terms of your health maintenance whether that’s getting your vaccines in order, some screenings done, just so we can really get a good assessment for where your health is at along with the foot care and checking kind of like a holistic review to make sure that you are healthy in regard to your diabetes in general.  And then the last thing being potentially nutritionist referral to make sure that your diet is like on track and what it should be.  They can help you even measure out where your body is at in terms of like what’s typical or what’s healthy in an individual your age and that could be of use too.  Does that all sound okay so far?"
"83","  Okay.  Is there anything else that you wanted to bring up or discuss with me today that we didn’t quite get to that you think would be important?"
"84","  Yeah."
"85","  Yeah, so I have a big hunch there a lot of what you are dealing with has to do with your diabetes that you are trying to manage and sometimes missing those appointments can lead to problems that we don’t see holistically."
"86","  Yeah, yeah, and hopefully we can just get you right in and once you are on track, we can start to sort out those little problems, so say that you have too many lipids and you need to lower those a little bit and your doctor will help explain more at those that if they are too high, then maybe we lower on and that helps you feel better.  And there is all those little things we can do to make little adjustments to hopefully get you feeling on the right track.  And so my biggest hunch is that your experiences right now with fatigue have to do with some of those missed appointments, maybe some of the things I mentioned the diet, the exercise, the regular screening and stuff like that and make sure you don’t have anything kind of correlated to your current disease.  Does that make sense?"
"87","  Yeah, so your next steps will be a lot on my part just kind of sending you out those referrals and making sure that those providers know your situation, kind of what you have explained to me, so you don’t have to explain it twice and then going from there we can get hopefully some better progress for you in regard to your goals and whatnot."
"88","  Yeah, of course.  It was so nice to meet you Freddie.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.  So have release from me and all the grandkids…."
"89","  Alright you too and have a good one."
"90","  Alright, bye."
"91","  Oh, that’s okay."
"92","  Yes, see those three little dots, there is a red one and orange one and a green one potentially?  "
"93","  Okay, no worries."
"94","  Maybe the top left corner of your screen and there is an X somewhere?"
