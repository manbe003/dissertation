"1","  Hello! Can u hear me Mr. Johnson."
"2","  I will try to talk loudly."
"3","  Haha.  Alright, well it is good to meet you.  I am Tessa Moore.  I will be your provider today.  I would love to hear from you again. Yes,Tessa."
"4","  Okay, tell me more.  What does the woman want?"
"5","  Hmm hmm.  Are you having symptoms that she is worried about it is COVID?"
"6","  Hmm hmm.  Okay.  Has anything been going on recently with your health that you are worried about?"
"7","  Hmm hmm.  Or that she is?"
"8","  Hmm hmm."
"9","  How long that has been going on?  I appreciate it "
"10","  Or days, weeks or months."
"11","  Correct."
"12","  Do you think it has been weeks?"
"13","  Correct.  Has it changed at all over the weeks that you have had it?"
"14","  Okay.  "
"15","  Are you coughing up anything or does it feel pretty dry?"
"16","  Yeah.  How about any chest pain with it?"
"17","  Hmm hmm."
"18","  No.  What about any other symptoms of being sick like congestion "
"19","  Sure. Have you had diarrhea?"
"20","  How long that has been going on?"
"21","  Okay. So, it has been going on a while. "
"22","  Okay, but it is not you do not always have diarrhea? It is not like that."
"23","  Okay.  Okay.  I will jump back to that in a bit but I want to hear a little bit more about this cough.  Have you had any sore throat?"
"24","  Okay.   What about any fevers"
"25","  Just the cough.  Okay.  Have you been exposed to anyone else who has been sick?"
"26","  You do not think so.  Okay.  So, no known exposures to anyone with COVID or any other sicknesses.  "
"27","  Okay."
"28","  Did you get your vaccines for COVID?"
"29","  And the booster.  Okay.  Awesome.  And has your wife been sick at all or your?"
"30","  Okay.  So it sounds like this cough has been going on for a while though it is not new in the last couple of days. "
"31","  Okay.  Okay. "
"32","  Yeah I want you be safe as well.   Okay.  Have you had a cough like this in the past, ever?"
"33","  This is new."
"34","  Okay.  What about other health changes like weight loss that you did not expect, any like night sweats?"
"35","  No, no other issues."
"36","  Okay.  Do you have any chronic health conditions?"
"37","  Yeah.  You got something you keep active, which is great.  Okay.  How about anything like high blood pressure? "
"38","  Any heart conditions?"
"39","  Okay.  Any known lung conditions?."
"40","  History of asthma?"
"41","  Okay.  That sounds good."
"42"," And do you take any daily medications for anything?"
"43","  Okay.  How long have you been taking it?"
"44","  Okay, so not everyday."
"45","  Okay.  Have you taken anything for this cough?"
"46","  Yeah, or like, do cough drops help it or cough medicine help it?"
"47","  Okay."
"48","  Yeah, if there is anything you have taken, would just like to know."
"49","  (Laughing) Oh yeah well, just seeing if you tried anything yet.  And is there anything that makes it worse, like cold weather or when you walk it gets worse or when you are working in construction it gets worse?"
"50","  Okay."
"51","  Okay.  Does it feel like a tickle in your throat or what is making your cough?"
"52","  Okay.  Kind of a tickle in your throat."
"53","  Hmm hmm.  "
"54","  Yeah.  Do you have any history of allergies like seasonal allergies."
"55","  Okay.  Okay."
"56","  All right. And you said you have not had anything like this before?"
"57","  Okay. Just running through a little bit, the rest of your medical chart to make sure I have everything."
"58"," I see that you do not have any known allergies.  Is that still correct?"
"59","  Medications or anything?"
"60","  Okay.  And I see that you take your cold medicine as needed, but no other daily medications? Correct."
"61","  Okay.  And that you do not have any tobacco use history? Yeah, correct.  Okay. And do you drink 2-3 beers daily?"
"62","  Okay.  All right.  And then otherwise, no really chronic problems for you?  That you are getting treatment for?"
"63","  Okay. Do you have any other recreational drug use?"
"64","  No. Okay.  And then any big surgeries that you have had in the past?"
"65","  Yeah, you are intact?  Okay.  Well, that is good.  Okay, well, for this cough given time of year and that you are not having any other symptoms of COVID, it seems less likely that a cough going on for several weeks is COVID without kind of a more significant illness. "
"66","  Yeah, so it is possible that you could have some kind of cold I think it is also possible that you could be having some, like seasonal allergies with some postnasal drip that is irritating the back of your throat, which can cause that tickle.  Do you feel congested in your nose at all?"
"67","  Hmm hmm."
"68","  Yeah. Okay.  Well, if you have a home COVID test, you can always do one which would you know, give some peace of mind?  I think it is unlikely given your symptoms and I saw that you had not like lost your sense of smell or sense of taste."
"69","  And really have not felt sick otherwise, besides this cough."
"70","  No, I think that is great.  So I think COVID is pretty unlikely but taking a home test would be totally fine.  I think given what you are explaining and the time of year some allergies with postnasal drip would be most likely and probably the easiest to try treating and see if that helps.  So you can try a daily allergy medication like a Zyrtec or an Allegra and those can be purchased over the counter. "
"71","  Hmm Hmm Or I can write you a script for it whichever is easier. "
"72","  And then you might also want to try some Flonase, which is a nasal spray, which can help reduce cold, congestion, it is called Flonase."
"73","  And it is a nasal spray that you would use twice a day for the first week and then I think go to once a day, and I can write you a script for that. "
"74","  And that helps reduce the congestion so that you are not having anything dripping back to the back of your throat, which might be causing this irritation.  "
"75","  So I think that would be the kind of least invasive thing to try first and try you know, for a week or two taking some allergy medications and see if it helps at all, and if it does not, let me know, and we can meet again, to problem solve to see if there is something else going on. "
"76","  Yeah.  And then as far as the general exam to do kind of a yearly wellness visit, I would really want to see you in person and I think that is a great thing to do to just make sure that we have covered everything and done any screenings that you might be due for but I would like to have my patients come in person so that I am not missing anything over the computer screen.  Does that make sense?"
"77","  Okay,"
"78","  Exactly. We would like to get your vitals and just get eyes on you a little more than this part on a screen. "
"79","  So if you wanted me to schedule that to see you."
"80","  That would be great and come in to the office for that.  Okay, so I will write you two prescriptions, one for Zyrtec, which is a daily allergy pill and then one for Flonase, which is that spray."
"81","  And try taking that for like a week or two and see if it is helping the throat at all. "
"82","  If that cough is going away, we are probably on the right track and you can just send me a message.  Are you on my chart? You know, like online? Health System? My Chart?"
"83","  Okay.  It is like online,"
"84","  A kind of, for health thing.  So you are able to securely message me on there.  When you come in for your wellness, we will have them set you up if you are interested with the My chart account and it just makes it much easier to talk to me instead of trying to call the clinic which can be, can be a pain.  So if you are interested in that, we can do that and then we can chat on there. "
"85"," Otherwise, feel free to call and leave a message for me and I can get back to any questions you have."
"86","  Yeah.  Anything else I can help you with?  Are there questions you have right now?"
"87","  Okay."
"88","  All right. Well, I will send those off to your pharmacy and let me know if anything comes up and otherwise keep up the great activeness and stay safe."
"89"," All right. Bye"
"90","  Hmm hmm."
