"1","  Yeah, it looks like."
"2"," I guess so.  I got kind of a strange picture coming up here that, angle, strange."
"3","  How you doing?"
"4","  I am sorry, I did not quite hear that."
"5","  Edwin. Oh, yeah, I read it up there at the top.  Hi, Edwin."
"6","  Me too."
"7","  Yeah, sure, great."
"8","  Oh well, I am supposed to come in and check on my diabetes about every four months or so and I have not been in for about a year and so I want to take care of my health. So here I am."
"9","  Well, yeah, I am just, I am just kind of getting more tired all the time and one of my main concerns is I want to be able to keep up with my grandkids and right now they are just running me ragged."
"10","  I could use a little extra energy, that is for sure."
"11","  Oh, it has been building, you know, over the last few years or so more in the last year, I guess."
"12","  I am not sure about the imbalance, I am not sure what you mean there."
"13","  Oh, no, no."
"14","  Yeah, and wanting to keep on track with, you know, my treatment stuff."
"15","  Oh, I do not know."
"16","  I am okay, but hang on a second while I rebuild the background here."
"17","  Let us see if we are still in the same place here.  Yeah, I think we are good.  Yeah, I just have a screen here in back of me and I just backed up the chair and knocked it over, so should be okay now.  Sorry about that."
"18","  I think it just builds during the day, you know and so just a gradual thing over the day."
"19","  Not really, no, I do not have a plan for that."
"20","  No."
"21","  Well, only when I watch television and try to figure out what is going on in the world, but not as a general thing.  No."
"22","  Well, I used to get more numbness in my feet, but I have not had that for a while."
"23","   No."
"24","  Yeah, I guess so."
"25","  Especially, you know, like after work I will get home and my wife takes care of our grandkids when their parents are at work and so when I get home, I like to play with kids and everything, but I tell you, I just run out of energy when I am, I got to go lie down for a while and. I am not one for taking naps, so it is kind of."
"26","  Well, I have never run a marathon, but I do not know what it does like but I just kind of feel fatigued I guess is a good way of saying it."
"27","  Not so much short of breath, no."
"28","  Yeah, I take metformin twice a day and the glipizide and yeah, I am trying to keep up with all of that. "
"29","  Pardon me?"
"30","  Yeah, yeah. I get insurance through my employer, so that is fine. "
"31","  Yeah, I did that this morning, you know, it was about 215."
"32","  A little bit, yeah."
"33","  It is about typical, I guess."
"34","  Oh, always before, twice a week on generally Tuesdays and Saturdays."
"35","  No, I thought I was not supposed to."
"36","  Exactly"
"37","  Yeah."
"38","  No."
"39","  Basically the diabetes meds like metformin."
"40","  Not I know of, no."
"41","  Ah, my mom.  Yeah, my mom has got diabetes."
"42","  Type 2."
"43","  No, I do not think so.  With my dad, he passed away a couple of years ago, so, but just natural causes I guess."
"44","  I do not think so.  No"
"45","  Oh, I do not know.  We did not keep track of them all the time.  But, I mean, I had normal things that kids get, you know, chickenpox."
"46","  But survived somehow.  Here I am."
"47","  Oh, I do not know.  I know it has gone up a little bit, but it is still down below 8, which I know is good, but I do not remember 7.9 I remember a year ago it is 7.4.  Is that?"
"48","  Oh "
"49","  So it is still below 8 though, right?"
"50","  Good."
"51","  Yeah, you know I do not want to get on insulin, "
"52","  Okay.  Again think of anything and as long as we can avoid getting on insulin then as you say, just adjust the meds, the metformin and glipizide a little bit and that should keep me on track and"
"53","  Okay, great."
