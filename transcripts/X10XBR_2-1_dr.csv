"1","  Hi Tom.  Can you hear me?"
"2","  I am Leah. I heard that you are interested in getting a general checkup today."
"3","  Okay.  How are you doing?  What has been going on?"
"4","  Okay, so I heard you have been having a cough, kind of a low-grade fever and some increased fatigue.  Is that true?"
"5","  Okay.  That has been going on for a week.  Have you been in contact with anybody that is sick?"
"6","  Okay.  And just to double check, you are not having any difficulty breathing right now, right?"
"7","  Okay.  And when you have been checking your fever, what numbers are you getting?"
"8","  Okay, but you are having like chills and muscle aches and stuff like that."
"9","  Okay, just feeling a little warm over here."
"10","  Okay, alright, okay, have you tried using a home COVID test yet?"
"11","  Okay.  And are you vaccinated for COVID?"
"12","   Okay, hmm, okay.  Why do not you tell me a little bit more about like how you are feeling, so, like about a week ago, what symptom did you notice first and how did you know you were sick?"
"13","  Just a cough. okay.  Is a cough waking you up at night?"
"14","  Okay.  And you are just coughing throughout the day?"
"15","   Okay.  And when you say that you are more tired than usual, what do you mean by that?"
"16","  Okay.  Are you able to go to work and do the things that you need to do?"
"17","   Okay.  When you breathe, do you feel like you breathe noisier than usual."
"18","  Okay.  Have you had any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain?"
"19","  Okay.  And do you have anybody that lives with you right now that can take care of you when you are sick?"
"20","  Okay, okay.  Would you be willing to come into the clinic? you could get a COVID test, something that you want."
"21","  Okay, okay.  And looks like you are taking DayQuil as needed.  How often are you having to take that right now?"
"22","  Okay.  And do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse over time?"
"23","  Okay. okay, well, based on what you are telling me, I do feel like it is reasonable to check for COVID, and I want you to do that but I also do want to be able to listen to your lungs and kind of hear what is going on, just in case there is something else happening.  Would you be okay coming in and letting me talk to you for 15 minutes, examine you, and also getting the COVID test at the same time?"
"24","  Okay, alright, so we will try to get you in within the next one or two days, but I do want to say that if you are experiencing any worsening in your symptoms, any like shortness of breath, chest pain, feeling like something is wrong, I want you to go to urgent care or the ED, okay? Or emergency department."
"25","  Okay.  And you are able to do that?  Your girlfriend can take you there? "
"26","  Okay, perfect.  Any other questions that you have or anything else you want to talk about?"
"27","  Okay, alright.  Well, thank you for checking in with me and I am glad that we got to talk about this and we have a plan going forward."
"28","  Alright.  Do you know how to get out of the meeting?"
"29","   Okay, alright, see you in a couple of days then, Tom. Bye, bye."
