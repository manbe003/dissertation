"1","  Hello."
"2","  Hi, my name is Benjamin.  Is it okay to call you Tom?"
"3","  Tom, while here, so I’ll be kind of talking to you little bit today.  It sounds like you said that you were having some fevers, some fatigues, some cough, kind of tell me what’s been going on?"
"4","  Understandably so and it has definitely taken over quite a few parts of our country so it is nice to, you have somebody that cares for you and wants you to come talk with me."
"5","  When did this all start?"
"6","  10 years, okay, okay.  Are you pretty healthy otherwise?"
"7","  Yeah, okay and so you said this has been going on for a few days now, was it?"
"8","  Okay.  You feel like you are getting better, worse or staying the same?"
"9","  Staying the same, okay."
"10","  Little fever.  How have you been taking your temperature?"
"11","  Okay, so you more feel walk so okay, okay and anything else that you’ve been feeling, the cough, are you coughing anything up at all?"
"12","  Okay, what are you coughing up?"
"13","  Yeah, okay.  Okay, have you been around anybody else that’s been sick?"
"14","  Okay, okay.  It is hard to know because a lot of people with COVID they don’t have any symptoms so even if they don’t feel sick it doesn’t mean that you can’t catch it.  Yeah, you know, so that’s something to be mindful of.  So, have you tried taking anything at home to make you feel to kind of treat the cough or what have you been doing?"
"15","  Yeah, it says that you have DayQuil on your medication list, have you been taking that."
"16","  Okay.  How many times per day have you been trying to take that?"
"17","  Okay, okay and besides that, any other, any other cough syrups or anything like that you are using to help you sleep or get through the night?"
"18","  No, okay, okay and so just a couple of other questions we have, you know, COVID can cause some other symptoms, it sounds like you haven’t had any loss of taste or smell, is that correct?"
"19","  Okay, have you been having any chest pain, shortness of breath?"
"20","  Do you feel like you are able to get out and walk around like you normally do or do you feel like you can’t because of the cough or?"
"21","  Oh, gosh, yeah I, okay so you are still kind of ____ it what sounds like, yeah.  Have you had a chance at all to go get tested at any of the free testing locations?"
"22","  Not yet.  Is that something you’d be interested in?"
"23","  Yeah, yeah, I hear you.  Well, sometimes it is better to know if your girlfriend is really concerned that could be a pretty nice way to kind of resolve the fear if you will and it will probably help you have a little bit of peace of mind for whether you should stay home and relax or whether you should keep going to work because the last thing you want to do is, you know, if you do have COVID pass it on to somebody else, right?"
"24","  Have you been vaccinated at all?"
"25","  Haven’t got the shot.  Is that because you were, was there any particular reason for that you didn’t, have you just not gone around to?"
"26","  Wait and see, okay, okay and how about your baseline, you know, before all this started did you feel like, were you noticing any symptoms as well, were you pretty much able to do whatever you wanted during everyday activities?"
"27","  Okay, okay and briefly I want to circle back.  You mentioned you hadn’t been to the doctor in about 10 years?"
"28","  So, was there a reason for that or just didn’t feel like there was any need to go or do you have any issues, paying for the doctor any insurance issues that you know of?"
"29","  Fit as a fiddle.  Good, that’s what we like to hear, that’s what we like to hear.  Have you, do you take any other medications at home?"
"30","  Besides the DayQuil, any vitamins or anything like that?"
"31","  No, okay.  It sounds like you are able to do everything you want to do for work.  What do you do for work?"
"32","  Construction, that’s pretty physical too, jeez."
"33","  Yeah, is there, do you know if you’ve come into contact with any chemicals or anything that they warned you might be causing, it might eventually cause lung problems?"
"34","  Okay, okay and out of curiosity any in particular that they’ve told you about you might need to be concerned or use the mask for?"
"35","  Okay, as sometimes you the chemicals that they have people interact with their work they cause lung problems too that will make them cough and you know maybe act up sometimes.  One other question, any recent travels for you?"
"36","  Okay.  Have you ever spent time in Central or South America, Africa or any place like that before?"
"37","  Okay, okay and then just kind of going through the rest of your history it sounds like you don’t have any other medical problems that you have been treated for the past.  Have you ever had any surgeries?"
"38","  No surgeries.  Any family history of cancers at all?"
"39","  No. Any family history do you think might be pertinent to what we are talking about today?"
"40","  No, okay.  And then just kind of making sure I am not going to miss anything I am just going to go kind of head to toe and ask you a bunch of questions about symptoms and if you feel any of those symptoms, you felt any of those symptoms recently you just kind of stop me, okay?"
"41","  So, any changes in your vision or speech?"
"42","  No.  Any problems with balance or dizziness?"
"43","  You already mentioned no chest pain but have you felt any heart racing or pounding in your chest?"
"44","  Okay.  Have you felt short of breath at all with any of the activities that you’ve done in the past year or so?"
"45","  No, okay.  Any problems with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?"
"46","  Time to time, okay.  Anything worse recently?"
"47","  And then any problems with urination, blood in your urine, having to go more frequently?"
"48","  Okay, and last but not least having you noticed any pain in your legs, any problems moving your arms or your legs, any numbness or tingling?"
"49","  No, okay.  Well that’s pretty much all the questions I have.  Is there anything you want to talk about that I haven’t already covered before I kind to get to a couple of things I am thinking about?"
"50","  A general checkup.  Is anything in particular that she was concerned about or that you are concerned about besides this cough?"
"51","  Yeah, I guess one question I didn’t ask was which you know can sometimes cause these concerns, is there any tobacco use that you have on a daily basis or in the past?"
"52","  No, I see here that in your chart that you drink about two to three beers per day, is that accurate?"
"53","  Yeah, any other liquor or hard alcohol use that you have?"
"54","  You prefer beers, okay.  IPAs or what sort of beers are you drinking?"
"55","  Got you, got you and it about two to three every day you would say?"
"56","  Yeah, how much so when those bowl game, you know, whenever you do drink."
"57","  Okay.  Is that every weekend or kind of here and there?"
"58","  Okay.  And then any other drug use besides alcohol, or any other drug use, meth, heroin."
"59","  Yeah, street stuff."
"60","  Okay, okay.  Okay, well that’s pretty much all the questions I wanted to ask you.  There is a couple of things I would like to talk to you about before we kind of move on.  The first is what you came in for and that is really this question about COVID right?"
"61","  This cough, everybody around that’s in the past year obviously changed all of our lives.  COVID is real and a lot of people don’t want to talk about it and the fact that you have a cough and fever, feeling fatigued it is reassuring you don’t have a lot of other symptoms but I am concerned that you might have COVID, it presents differently in different people."
"62","  And so, I think from my perspective you know I would like to know the answer before giving further advise and so for me it is easy for you to get tested, I would say that is probably appropriate for you to go get tested.  What do you think about that?"
"63","  Yeah, it is a little, they stick that little fuzzy tube up your nose and kind of swirl it around a little bit and you get your test back in less than 72 hours, three days."
"64","  Yeah, do you feel like you would be able to get that done just I am not sure if our clinic here actually supplies the tests but I know that there is a lot of free resources or free testing sites for people to go get the test.  Do you feel like that’s something you’d be able to kind of figure out if we gave you some resources?"
"65","  Okay, okay well I think that that would probably be a pretty appropriate next step and then it sounds like your girlfriend would feel little bit better too."
"66","  Well, the next thing I was hoping to talk to you about a little bit is the alcohol consumption and has anybody every talk to you about that before?"
"67","  What are your feelings on it, do you feel like that’s an appropriate amount of alcohol to drink on a daily basis or not?"
"68","  Yeah, okay, well I would like to share little bit of information with you.  The recommendations right now are a maximum of two drinks per day for men, and so if you are going over that, it is something to be mindful of that there could be some consequences to your health in the future, I am not saying not right now but couple of."
"69","  Yeah, yeah, I mean it feels okay for now but there is with the pandemic, the stress, work, life in general it gets hard and so often a lot of people will go from two beers a day to three beers a day and sometimes it goes up a little bit higher, you know, with that you can have problems in your liver, your heart, your brain and what I want to do as your doctor is I want to make sure that you are as healthy as you could possibly be."
"70","  Yeah, and so I just want to plant a little seed in your head that in the future there might be something to think about that, you know, and maybe cut back a little bit especially if you start noticing any effects in your relationships, anything at work or if we find that there is some changes in some of your lab work.  I just wanted to start the conversation now and kind of see where you are at with your alcohol use."
"71","  Yeah, is there anything that kind of keep you from wanting to stop, you just like it or do you think that there is no, is there anything that can stop me from just stopping tomorrow?"
"72","  You don’t see a problem, okay, okay.  Well I mean that sounds pretty reasonable I just wanted to bring it up, I wouldn’t be doing my due diligence if I didn’t.  Perfect, well, I am going to reach out to I guess I will call __Alia__ the clinic administrator and bring her back in."
"73","  Is there any other questions you have Tom?"
"74","  That will do it, okay since you understand what the plan is, can you tell me what the plan is?"
"75","  Yeah, that’s the plan, that’s the plan.  Well it was great to meet you and I hope you feel better."
"76","  Yeah, all right, I’ll ___ now somehow let’s see."
