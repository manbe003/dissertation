"1","  Hello."
"2","  Pleasure to meet you as well."
"3","  Tom, Tom works for me."
"4","  Well, I am coming in.  I have a cough right now and my girlfriend, she is concerned that it could possibly be COVID and so, she has been kind of bugging me to come in and have you check it up."
"5","  Sure."
"6","  Approximately five days ago."
"7","  I have with the cold and with the cough itself, I have like off-white mucus whenever I cough up any type of phlegm."
"8","  Okay and the only other thing that I have noticed more so than anything else is that I am, I am tired, a little more tired than usual."
"9","  No."
"10","  No."
"11","  No."
"12","  ________ (Laughs)."
"13","  No."
"14","  No."
"15","  No."
"16","  No."
"17","  No."
"18","  No."
"19","  No."
"20","  Yes, I have been experiencing diarrhea about once every three weeks.  Okay."
"21","  That started about three years ago."
"22","  Yes."
"23","  I just, I just noticed that it was, it was happening about three years ago and I would say different, probably different foods, different activities probably aggravated, but this has been fairly consistent over you know, the past three years."
"24","  Though I just thought it was regular, but..."
"25","  That is true (laughs)."
"26","  Great."
"27","  No."
"28","  No, no, none of that."
"29","  You are right (laughs)."
"30","  No."
"31","  No."
"32","  No (laughs)."
"33","  No."
"34","  Sick?  Umm, maybe five years ago, but I, I am fairly healthy otherwise."
"35","  Hmm, hmm."
"36","  No."
"37","  No."
"38","  No."
"39","  Vitamins, yes."
"40","  Just Multivitamin for Men."
"41","  No."
"42","  No."
"43","  No."
"44","  If you consider two to three beers alcohol, yes, I, I have alcohol."
"45","  Well, generally, I would say a week.  It may vary, depends.  It would depend on the meal and my girlfriend likes to have a pizza on Friday.  So, I will have, you know, a couple of beers with my pizza."
"46","  Yes, hmm."
"47","  No."
"48","  No."
"49","  No, not really."
"50","  Just since I started feeling five days ago, and so, I, I just take it two to three times a day as recommended, you know."
"51","  Hmm, hmm."
"52","  Good, hmm, hmm."
"53","  Well, I have felt that it was maybe a low-grade fever that I have had.  It comes and goes and I would say it is probably 99 or something like that."
"54","  Hmm, I would say yes, but my work day starts very early in the morning because I am a laborer for a construction company and generally by that time I get off to work, I am really exhausted.  So, I could research that, yes."
"55","  And getting tested.  And you, may, I have a question. You are not able to provide a test today."
"56","  Sure, that is the answer I wanted."
"57","  We could do that, right. Okay (laughs)."
"58","  Right, we will do that (Laughs)."
"59","  Yeah, that is good question (Laughs)"
"60","  Sure, right, hmm, hmm."
"61","  Sure."
"62","  Hmm, hmm."
"63","  Sure."
"64","  Hmm, hmm."
"65","  Hmm, hmm."
"66","  Sure."
"67","  Hmm, hmm."
"68","  Hmm, hmm."
"69","  Right, exactly (laughs)."
"70","  Sure, okay."
"71","  Okay, great."
"72","  Yes, hmm, hmm."
"73","  Hope that (laughs)."
"74","  Sure, hmm, hmm."
"75","  Hmm, hmm."
"76","  Sure."
"77","  Yeah, exactly, I agree with you (laughs), okay."
"78","  Hmm, hmm."
"79","  Yeah, sure, hmm, hmm."
"80","  I would say about once a week, it may happen, hmm, hmm."
"81","  I would say the majority of time, I can get there.  It is not, not too terribly uncomfortable."
"82","  I know, it is generally a little bit darker than my normal stool, but nothing I would say that is darker or bloody."
"83","  That made sense."
"84","  Okay (laughs)."
"85","  Yeah."
"86","  Right (laughs)."
"87","  Any, sorry? Say it again?"
"88","  No, no."
"89","  No, no."
"90","  No, I haven't."
"91","  53, I am sorry 58."
"92","  Yes, my grandfather passed from colon cancer, possibly.  I was very young at that time and then my mother, she beat breast cancer, but she passed about two years ago when she was 75 years old from natural causes."
"93","  And so my father is still alive, so that's all the history I have on my direct family."
"94","  Never crossed my mind, no."
"95","  (Laughs)."
"96","  Okay (laughs)."
"97","  Yeah, sure, hmm."
"98","  Okay, that sounds great."
"99","  Okay, okay."
"100","  Okay, that sounds great."
"101","  Well, 10 years ago."
"102","  (Laughs)."
"103","  Oh, that sounds great.  If that will, yeah.  I would say that that would probably work since I am already here, yeah."
"104","  (Laughs) Okay."
"105","  Oh, okay, hmm, hmm."
"106","  No, like I say, that has been quite some time, approximately 10 years since I had a doctor's visit, and in that time, I have been fairly healthy.  So no, it has not crossed my mind at all."
"107","  Hmm, hmm."
"108","  Sure, hmm, hmm."
"109","  Hmm, hmm."
"110","  Okay, all right."
"111","  Okay and I think this would be please my girlfriend as well. I think she would be happy (laughs)."
"112","  That is great."
"113","  (Laughs) Great."
"114","  No, you, you have been thorough in terms of trying to assess my situation here, and so, I really appreciate it."
"115","  Okay, all right, looking forward to it."
"116","  Okay, same here."
