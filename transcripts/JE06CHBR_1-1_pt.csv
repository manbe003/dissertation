"1","  How’s that, is that good?"
"2","  Oh, because I was, it did not appear there, I just waved my mouse over it.  Wow okay."
"3","  Yeah."
"4","  Oh, I am pretty good."
"5","  Yeah, sure, sure."
"6","  I will tell you.  I got diabetes, so I am supposed to go to the doctor like every four months or so, I haven’t been for about a year.  So, I am a little concerned about my diabetes."

"8","  Like in the afternoons sometimes and I am just worried about that, whether it’s something to do with my diabetes or yeah, just getting old, you know?  I don’t know what that is, but it’s bothering me."
"9","  That’s all I can think of."
"10","  Okay."
"11","  Not really."
"12","  But it’s, I am getting tired, I am getting tired, fatigued, just getting to me, I guess."
"13","  And I don’t know if that’s related to the diabetes or what?"
"14","  Well, I have noticed it, maybe about some five, six months ago.  My wife has been taking care of our grandchildren.  We have got three of them and they just, they come home in after school, my wife takes care of them you know during the day and I come home, you know, I like to play with them, you know?  Because they are just cute, they are just cute you know.  They are like, one of them is, the little one is like 2 years old, he is just, Tom, he is in there is what I am saying and it’s hard to keep up with them."
"15","  And I feel, sometimes I get home and I just feel like taking a nap or something and you know I just don’t want to waste my time with the kids and you know, they grow up so damn fast."
"16","  That one, yeah.  There a lot of them, there is something out there."
"17","  Sleeping is good.  I think I get about between seven and eight hours."

"19","  But I will sleep right after it."
"20","  Oh, just may be once or twice a week."
"21","  Pretty good."
"22","  Pretty good.  I get my hand on my breakfast and two coffees and then I feel pretty good."
"23","  Yeah, better because this is the way to start for me."
"24","  It mostly hits me in the afternoon after I have been up for a while."
"25","  Well, I haven’t noticed it getting worse.  It’s just, you know, it just not getting better."
"26","  No, not really."
"27","  Weight is pretty much the same."
"28","  No, I haven’t noticed that."
"29","  I tried having something like strong like a couple of cokes, you know."
"30","  Caffeine hit in the afternoon, but you know, you know that keeps you up for a little while, then it doesn’t last."
"31","  No."
"32","  I just, I don’t know.  The thing I am worried about is that I am getting old and sick and ready to die, I guess, you know which is something to think about, but then I thought that you know it might be related to my diabetes, you know because I know that that’s an issue."
"33","  So, I am thinking I just -- well, I will go have it checked out and see what is going on."
"34","  Yeah."
"35","  No, no."
"36","  No, nothing."
"37","  No."
"38","  No."
"39","  No."
"40","  Yeah, I guess so."
"41","  Yes, I think that was it."
"42","  Yeah, ______ procedure was that and just like that ___ up to it as hell."
"43","  Oh, man.  I was just, I was -- no sleep and a lot of going to the bathroom."
"44","  No, no."
"45","  Yeah."
"46","  No, that pretty much, I think we got that surrounded."
"47","  Yeah, yeah."
"48","  Yeah, yeah, that would be fine."
"49","  Yeah."
"50","  Okay."
"51","  Okay.  Yeah, I am good.  I am kind of busy right now."
"52","  But, because I do like, I am an administrator, a homecare coordinator for a nursing home and basically that means if anything goes wrong anywhere it’s my fault."
"53","  So it is a lot of work right around at that time."
"54","  I got some vacation time coming up, I think that is okay."
"55","  Oh yes, yes and no.  I mean people are not mean about it, but they just, I mean the refrigerator don’t work or the air conditioning is too cold, or you know and it’s stuff like that."
"56","  No, I just mostly, it’s just my energy levels haven’t been very good.  My mood is okay."
"57","  Oh, I can probably do that, I will do that, yeah."
"58","  Well, here’s what I can figure based on you want to check my, you want to get my blood tested and see if there is anything strange in there and go from there I guess."
"59","  Okay."
"60","  Okay, okay.  Thank you.  I will try to get that bloodwork done."
