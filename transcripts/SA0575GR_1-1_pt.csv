"1","  Hello!"
"2","  Tom, please."
"3","  Oh, I guess I am okay."
"4","  Well, I thought I was doing alright but my partner insisted that I come and see you."
"5","  Well, I have had this cough for I don’t know a while now and she is worried.  She wants me to have that COVID test."
"6","  Oh, I guess this has probably been about a week now, I guess."
"7","  No, it is not dry.   I get that tickle in my throat and then I get coughing up this stuff."
"8","  Any color or smell, well it’s just clear."
"9","  Well, I have been feeling little warm."
"10","  Well, I know myself and I am feeling warm."
"11","  About the same amount of time, I guess."
"12","  I don’t even know why I am here actually.  She just pushed me to come in here."
"13","  Well, no."
"14","  No."
"15","  I have been feeling a little tired. "
"16","  No, I have been fit as a fiddle until now, it is, you know."
"17","  No, no. "
"18","  Not that I know of."
"19","  Well, I am thinking about getting it."
"20","  Well, I don’t think so."
"21","  Right, right."
"22","  No, just work."
"23","   Construction."
"24","  No."
"25","  Well sure, you know, I would like to have a beer in the evening you know with supper."
"26","  Well, you know, I might have, I don’t know, two or three maybe and over the weekend if I am watching a ball game, I might have even four or five."
"27","  No.  I don’t use the stuff."
"28","  Yeah.  She is on by back.  "
"29","  She is just concerned about me."
"30","  Well, I thank you for pretty well guided in a nutshell.  She thought well maybe I should have a full go over from head to toe. "
"31","  Oh, not since high school.  I might have tried a cigarette or two."
"32","  Well, yeah."
"33","  Well, really none.  I don’t even know why I am here."
"34","  Oh gosh, it has been, I don’t think I have seen a doctor in 10 years."
"35","  That's right."
"36","  Yeah, I guess so.  That makes sense."
"37","  Well, if you think it’s best, I guess so."
"38","  Yeah, that makes sense."
"39","  Well.  I really don’t have any questions."
"40","  Thank you, likewise."
