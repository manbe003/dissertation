"1","  Hi, Freddie. How are you?"
"2","  I am doing well.  Nice to see you."
"3","  Yeah, of course, of course, yeah, it looks like so today we are here to talk about your diabetes a little bit.  How have you been feeling lately?"
"4","  Yeah, yeah. I know, now that sounds great.  Is there a reason you have not been in the last year?"
"5","  Okay.  Anything in particular you did not like about your last provider?"
"6","  Gotcha, gotcha.  Speaking of your meds, have you been taking those consistently?  It looks like we are on a couple of them."
"7","  Yeah, you are still taking those consistently."
"8","  Okay. Yeah.  No, that is good.  Everyone forgets a dose now and again, so but as long as you have refills and everything for that, that is something else we could take care of today if you need a refill on that medication."
"9","  Okay. Do you normally get those through the pharmacy?"
"10","  pharmacy Okay, we can get that sent over for you as well make sure you have enough supplies."
"11","  Okay.  You mentioned you have been feeling a little bit more tired lately.  About how long has that been going on?"
"12","  Have you been noticing this for like kind of the last few weeks, the last month, the last year?"
"13","  Last six months."
"14","  Okay. And?"
"15","  Okay.  Have you noticed anything that, like, makes your?  Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?"
"16","  Okay. Um, have you noticed anything that you know, like on days you are having more energy or less energy?  Have you noticed any correlations there?  Any changes in your daily habits or your sleep or what you're eating?"
"17","  I believe you know."
"18","   Gotcha. Gotcha.  Well, so far what I am thinking right now since your labs are kind of out of date here, looks like it is you said it has been about a year since the last time you have got your A1c and everything checked."
"19","  That is kind of the first thing I definitely want to do here is I want to get labs again."
"20","  So gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah.  Well, I mean to know that I guess then we are gonna have to get those labs to see exactly where you are at and we can know from there.  I guess one other thing I kind of want to talk about real quick here too is you, you mentioned part of the reason you left your other doctor was they are forcing, you know, kind of the eating habits and you were not ready to give that up yet.  I was curious, it sounds like diabetes, you know controlling, it is really important to you so that you are not on insulin and everything. I was curious if what your current exercise looks like or if we could kind of use exercise as a route to kind of help control your diabetes"
"21","  Okay.  Yeah, a couple ideas I might have for you. Are you at a desk most of your day then?"
"22","  Okay.  Something that might help here, I mean it does not sound like much to start off, but it could be a really good starters, I do not know if you can get a standing desk at work and every now and again, you know, stand up for 15-20 minutes or so.  I think that could help you out a little bit."
"23","  Yeah, I know, if that does not work with your office, that is totally fine.  But yeah, I mean, even standing up, taking a lap around the office every 30 minutes or so, I think could help out and maybe if you are able to get a walk in during lunch or something like that, even if it is just a little spurts, I think a little bit of movement throughout the day might help."
"24","  Okay, maybe there is even a longer way you can take to, to go on the walk and get just to, you know, get a little bit more in than usual because that might be helpful as well because you know, like I said, it sounds like controlling your diabetes is really important to you."
"25","  Okay.  And then so yeah like I said for the diabetes you know if we can get a little extra walking in anywhere, even if it is just little spurts like taking the long walk to lunch, I like the sounds of that and then as far as the tiredness goes, it kind of is a little bit normal.  You know as you increase levels in age you know the energy, your testosterone is going to fall a little bit but I would like to get some blood levels and see if anything else is going on here to see if there is anything out of the ordinary.  Until we do that, there is not a whole lot I can offer right now but after we get some blood work done and I think we can schedule a followup appointment, I think we can definitely see what direction we need to head down then."
"26","  Yeah. I think here in-house we have a place you can down the hall, I can send the order in and then you can go get your blood drawn there and they will run the tests."
"27","   And whatever is easiest for you.  If you have another place that is more accessible to you that that totally works."
"28","  Hmm.  Yeah, I guess I am not 100% sure of the coverage for that, but I can send the order in."
"29","  So does that sound like a plan to you then?  It sounds and what was the specific name of this place where you are at?"
"30","  Mirabella."
"31","  Okay, yeah, I can send.  You said this is a blood draw place?"
"32","  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry."
"33","  Yeah. Yeah. No, no, that is totally fine here.  So yeah, I am talking to get your blood drawn.  Is this a convenient place for you to get that done?"
"34","  Oh man, (laughing) I am so sorry.  That is totally my fault.  So yeah, I am at a clinic.  I am downtown as well on 15th Street."
"35"," We can schedule a followup with me as well if you would like and then I can go over the results of those lab values with you and then we can go from there to see where you are at on your diabetes and see if there is anything out of the ordinary so we can work on increasing that energy in the middle of the day for you as well."
"36","  All right. So yeah, I will, the address of the place that you need to go to is going to be 534 15th Street.   I will send the orders over there.  Do you have anything to write that down?"
"37","  Yes."
"38","  Yeah.  And you can do that at your convenience and then since I send the order in, they will send the results back over to me and then if you want to, how soon do you think you will be able to do that?"
"39","  Yeah, of course.  Do you want to schedule back to see me in two weeks then?"
"40","  All right, awesome.  Is there a time of the day that works best for you?"
"41","  Yeah.  Awesome.  If the same time works for you, we will get you down in two weeks, so today is June 7th, so we will go at June 21st and we will go at 7"
"42","   Yeah.  So do you have any questions for me?"
"43","  Okay. Well, yeah, yeah.  No, I mean if you have those concerns, we can talk about those before we go here.  Umm, so I mean it is like I said first step is it is a process, so first step here is going to be just getting those lab values and see if anything's out of ordinary and following that path but today without physically seeing you or anything like that, I think that is the first step we need to do here and then I will let you know where we go from there but I mean, I think fatigue and you know, it is a pretty common problem that affects a large percentage of the population here, so I am not overly concerned at the moment."
"44","  So on the 21st."
"45","  Awesome.  Well, I appreciate your time."
"46","  Yeah sounds great.  Look forward to it.  Bye."
