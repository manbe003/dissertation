"6","  Yeah, especially the 2-year-old; he is just into everything, which I have."
"7","  Yeah, yeah.  It is well, it is a little terrifying too because he is faster than me, you know."

"24","  Because my last doctor just annoyed me."
"25","  Yeah, he got kind of snippy about my diet.  He was like going ""well, no more fried chicken for you,"" and like that."
"26","  I don’t know, what are you?  So I, I just got mad at him."
"27","  Yeah, he was talking down to me."
"28","  Oh, let me think about that.  When I get up, I have some coffee and you know, eggs and hash browns and a little bit butter."
"29","  Lunch, I have to kind of get whatever I can get.  You know, I don't really have a lunch hour, you know, because I work.  When I am at work, I have to be available to all the _______, so it is not…."
"30","  So, it is whatever I can grab, which the closest thing is McDonald's."

"37","  A couple of times a week."
"38","  Generally on the weekends."
"39","  Oh, just anywhere around the neighborhood."
"40","  Sometimes we drive to a park and we walk around the park, and try to keep it, try to keep it a little bit interesting."
"41","  Yeah, _______."
"42","  Fun, you know."
"43","  Okay, I got, I have got health insurance and all that stuff, you know."
"44","  So yeah and I am good about taking the medication.  I might forget a day, maybe every two weeks or something."
"45","  But mostly going steady."
"46","  Oh, sure, sure, I am..."
"47","  Oh, sure, sure, sure.  I am curious."
"48","  Well, there is this _______ now for three years however."
"49","  Um."
"50","  Okay, good."
"51","  Well, sugary, well I heard the diet, the stuff they put in there is really bad for you."
"52","  You know…"
"53","  Better, better the devil you know?"
"54","  Good."
"55","  I, I did not know _______."
"56","  It's interesting."
"57","  I like my Coke, but you know it is, if it's you messing with my blood sugar, then probably let that go.  Problem is I haven't really looked at the menu _______, so I am wondering, is there something I can order? or Can I, can I get? can I get water there?"
"58","  Okay."
"59","  Because I am not going, well it is an option, it is not one."
"60","  It is not one you like."
"61","  Yeah, I don’t know."
"62","  Well, let's start with the soda, like you said."
"63","  And see how that, and see how that goes.  That might be the thing right there."
"64","  Oh, sure."
"65","  Okay."
"66","  Oh."
"67","  Oh, a friend of mine had that, he even got diagnosed with that.  He said he would wake up sometimes like startled, like with breathing…"
"68","  With breathing."
"69","  That's, that sounds good.  I haven't gotten anything like that."
"70"," Yeah, that sounded terrifying."
"71"," Oh, good."
"72","  I can ask my wife because she would notice if I would snore."
"73","  Because I have never really discussed it or even thought about it."
"74","  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  What's, what's the sleep thing, I have to go to sleep and somebody is…"
"75","  Oh, okay, I do that in my house."
"76","  Yeah, like I don't think I could sleep at a hospital."
"77","  Of course, you know."
"78","  Um, I am thinking, nothing that I could think of that all kinds of seem to be because you know, I was thinking about it because I thought, I thought it might be the diabetes because I know that can, that can _______ your energy levels."
"79","  And I knew that when I do that blood draw and check on my blood sugars."
"80","  It is kind of going up into the yellows."
"81","  But yeah, yeah, it sounds alright."
"82","  Okay."
"83","  Oh, yeah."
"84","  Yeah, yeah.  I can do that."
"85","  Oh, yeah probably, probably get time off.  I work at a retirement home."
"86","  There all the residents are just on me, all the time.  If anything goes wrong, I have to come to deal with it, you know?"
