"1","  Hello?  Oh, I don't think I can hear you.  I think, I think you're muted."
"2","  Hello, yes, I can hear you now."
"3","  Hi, my name is Indira.  I am a first-year medical student and I am a part of your care team today.  So, I'll be asking you a few questions.  Is there a preferred name you'd like me to address you by?"
"4","  Oh, so well nice to meet you Tom.  Could you tell me your date of birth, just to confirm?"
"5","  Awesome.  Thank you so much.  So Tom, what brings you in today?"
"6","  Yeah.  That makes sense.  Can you tell me a bit about your cough, like was it a dry cough, was it like, did you feel phlegm when you are coughing?"
"7","  Yeah.  Are you saying it started about a week ago?"
"8","  Were you around anyone that was sick during that time?"
"9","  Okay.  And did you have any other symptoms during this week?"
"10","  Yeah, any other symptoms besides the cough?"
"11","  Okay, perfect.  No like, kind of like no congestion in the nose or anything?"
"12","  Alright."
"13","  Okay, so you just had a slight fever.  Did you ever take your temperature?"
"14","  Okay.  Anything else that you've been feeling that's been different this last week?"
"15","  Yeah, feeling tired, more tired than usual?"
"16","  Yes.  Have you felt any wheezing or anything?"
"17","  Okay.  Any loss in taste or smell?"
"18","  Okay.  Yeah, and you mentioned that you, did you go take the COVID test already or are you here for that?"
"19","  Okay.  Okay.  And have you been vaccinated for COVID?"
"20","  Okay.  Is that something you're interested in talking about or…?"
"21","  Yeah.  Okay, are there any specific concerns you have with the vaccination?"
"22","  So, you're worried if it's actually working or not?"
"23","  Okay.  Do you know people who are currently vaccinated?"
"24","  Yeah.  Alright.  I think and there are -- people have, I mean, people want to know it's being -- what they're getting with the vaccination and whether it was working or not, I think if you're interested we can definitely talk about how the vaccination works and like what -- how people have been responding and how it's been -- what the numbers are just like in terms of protecting people from COVID after, like after our visit we can set up a different time, but if you're interested."
"25","  Yeah, definitely think about it and let us know, because we obviously we want to keep you as healthy as possible.  So we're here to talk you through any just any medical decision you want to take."
"26","  Awesome.  So just a good recap.  I know you had a cough for the past week and you feel that phlegm coming up.  You also had a slight fever.  Any other symptoms you can think of like headaches or like chills or anything? "
"27","  No, okay.  And then just to get your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with anything in the doctor's office?"
"28","  Yeah.  How long would you say it's been?"
"29","  Okay.  And that's some time.  Do you -- are you interested in setting up a primary care doctor and having a regular primary care doctor you can go to?"
"30","  I’m sorry, what?"
"31","  Okay, just trying to get the COVID thing, okay.  Have you ever had any other health issues in the past?"
"32","  Okay.  Do you know if you're up-to-date with your other immunizations besides the COVID vaccination?"
"33","  Okay.  And then these will be the next few questions about more like personal lifestyle factors, how would you describe your diet is?"
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Okay.  Yeah, and I know you mentioned beer.  If you have to ask somebody, how would you describe your alcohol intake is?"
"36","  Okay, yeah.  Two to three beers a night.  And then have you ever smoked tobacco?"
"37","  Okay.  And then how do you describe your physical exercise activity is in your life?"
"38","  Yeah, that sounds very nice, yeah.  Alright.  Well, that's thank you for answering these questions.  Going back to like the symptoms you've been feeling, have you been taking any medications for them?"
"39","  DayQuil.  Has DayQuil been helping?"
"40","  Okay.  Anything else you've been taking, anything else that's been helping?"
"41","  Okay, awesome.  So, I think from what you've told me, you've been feeling a cough and a slight fever.  Those are, I guess those are symptoms of COVID, but they are also symptoms of a cold or a flu.  So, I think, like let's definitely get you a COVID test while you're here and I think it might also be helpful to get the flu test as well.  Have you been vaccinated for the flu this year?  Hello?  Hello?"
"42","  Yeah, no worries.  I think I was just asking you if you've had the flu vaccination this year?"
"43","  Okay, yeah.  So let's get you a flu test as well and we can also draw in a Strep test.  Have you ever had anything called Strep before?"
"44","  Okay.  So we can also do a Strep test just to cover all of our bases and that also can examine the cough or fever.  Yeah, so I think next step let's get those tests done and see what information we get from that and then move forward with medications based on those tests.  And I think since DayQuil has been working so far for you, I think continue taking DayQuil or NyQuil until we get these test results back, which should be about like in a day.  Yeah, any other questions or anything you want to talk about?"
"45","  Okay, awesome.  And if you're interested, I can also send over information about the COVID vaccination, I'll just connect you with a doctor who works specifically with COVID and is good to help with the COVID vaccinations if you're interested."
"46","  Yeah, awesome.  Well, thank you so much for your time and I will let you know about the test results and hopefully we can get you back to feeling better."
"47","  Awesome.  Thank you.  Have a good day."
