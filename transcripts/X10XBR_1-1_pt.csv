"1","  I think I got it."
"2","  There we go. I got it now."
"3","  Hi."
"4","  Well, yeah, this machine just really gets to you."
"5","  Hahaha.  Yeah, I am supposed to come in every four months or so, and you know, check on my diabetes but I have not been for about a year, so I figured, you know, I want to take care of my health, so here I am."
"6","  Well, pretty good, but well, the main thing is I am just so tired.  It is like I am running out of energy here and uh, well, you know, I got to work and I got grandkids and they got energy that just wants to talk, you know?  So I am trying to keep up with them and they are bouncing, uh, I do not know.  I just get so tired, it is the main thing."
"7","  Okay.  "
"8","  Yeah, I do that twice a day."
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Well, I miss once in a while, you know, a couple of weeks I will forget a day or something, hmm."
"11","  Oh yeah, I do that a couple of times a week.  I did that this morning, in fact, it is 215."
"12","  Around 200."
"13","  I guess."
"14","  Oh yeah, my wife Louise is a great cook.  She takes good care of me."
"15","  I guess so.  You know, somewhat, yeah."
"16","  I have been trying to exercise more, you know, I have been doing more rounds around the facility that keeps me walking a little bit and then I try to do a walk, maybe every weekend if I can see if I can get Louise to go along and sometimes she would not, so you know I can do it by myself though."
"17","  No."
"18","   No."
"19","  No."
"20","  Oh yeah, used to, used to bother me a little bit, but that was before I started with those diabetes drugs, the metformin and glipizide seem to be doing the job okay."
"21","  Whoa.  A few years back, I guess.  I do not know.  My glasses are okay.  I can see alright."
"22","  Hmm.  I do not know."
"23","  Sure. I mean, you know, if that is what I need to."
"24","  Just can I come in on the weekends? Because I work during the week and so if I get that day like today to be free, would be.  Is that possible?"
"25","  Yeah, I just kind of run out of energy in the afternoon mostly and then by the time I get home my wife takes care of our grandkids because well, my son and my daughter are working, and my son-in-law too but anyway she takes care of the kids until I get home and then when I am supposed to take care of them, I am just running out of energy and I have a hard time keeping up with them."
"26","  Ah, yeah, more or less, I guess."
"27","  Well, yeah, so I tried to move around, you know, and get my circulation going."
"28","  Well, just my legs get tired and kind of sore."
"29","  More like an achy pain."
"30","  Hmm, cool. I guess it is kind of in between that sort of feels like they are falling asleep, but sort of aching too."
"31","  Well, sometimes, yeah, it is just that I cannot be taking naps at work, you know, it is so I got to kind of just muscle through it and do what I got to do."
"32","  I do not have that pain too much.  It is mostly from standing too much if I got to, you know, go around the facility and then stand there talking to somebody have had something, I do not know, they go on and on and so if I have to stand there alone, guy, I would rather be moving around actually, than standing in one place."
"33","  I am sorry, what?"
"34","  Uh, yeah, yeah, I guess it does. I have done it."
"35","  Nope"
"36","  No, no, no."
"37","  I wish no."
"38","  Hmm. Not really."
"39","  Guess they feel sort of warm"
"40","  I mean, just, you know. body temperature, I guess."
"41","  Oh, sometimes I am, but you know, mostly hits me in the afternoon."
"42","  Well, I guess so.  Do not you get iron from meat?  You know, I eat meat, so it.  Do not see why I would not have enough iron."
"43","  Oh"
"44","  Missing of what?"
"45","  Yeah, I keep track of my numbers."
"46"," They have been pretty good. I am down below 8, so that is the main thing for me is keeping it low."
"47","  Yeah, okay."
"48","  Sounds good, if you can do that next Saturday, that would be great."
"49","  Okay."
"50","  Hmm, just getting to be an old guy, or am I about to die or what? You know."
"51","  Okay."
"52","  Okay. I guess so, yeah."
"53","  Yeah, why do not we do that after we do this, the things next to Saturday."
"54","  Great."
"55","  You too, yes, thank you so much.  What do I what do here?"
"56","  Oh, I see it. Yeah, okay, great."
"57","  Thanks."
"58","  Bye."
