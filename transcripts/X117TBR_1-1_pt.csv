"1","  Hello."
"2","  Yes, I'm Tom."
"3","  Yes."
"4","  Well, my girlfriend has been encouraging me to come in and to get tested for COVID.  I've had a cough for the past five days and so she's concerned."
"5","  No, not really.  I have mixed feelings about it, but not really."
"6","  Yes, I, whenever I cough it's a little phlegm and that I cough up and it's like an off-white color."
"7","  No."
"8","  No just a little warm, but nothing you know that I'm concerned about, no."
"9","  No."
"10","  No."
"11","  I've had a cold before that seems to be my normal type of cold, but that's about it."
"12","  Yes, occasionally."
"13","  No, I haven’t been, you know, to the doctor in about 10 years and so maybe I should have, you know, maybe a general checkup or something."
"14","  Right."
"15","  Yes."
"16","  No."
"17","  Well, my grandfather had cancer.  I'm not sure, I think it was colon, but I'm not sure.  I was very young when that happened."
"18","  And my mother had breast cancer and she beat that and she died about two years ago at age 75, I would think of natural causes."
"19","  Okay, okay."
"20","  That sounds good."
"21","  No, I haven’t had a vaccination in a while, no."
"22","  I've heard of it, but I naturally have not had one."
"23","  Yes."
"24","  Yes."
"25","  No, I want to wait and see, wait a little bit longer before getting the vaccine.  Again, I've just had some different information about it, so I just want to make sure that is, that it’s the good thing to do."
"26","  No, not really.  Would you recommend the vaccine?"
"27","  Uh huh."
"28","  Mm hmm."
"29","  No, it's just been mixed messages that have been put out there, you know, you know with the local news, media and you know, news outlets, so it's just been kind of confusing."
"30","  Okay, okay.  I will consider your recommendation, okay got it."
"31","  Mm hmm."
"32","  Mm hmm."
"33","  Okay, okay."
"34","  No, I think my girlfriend would be pleased to know that I had the visit with you and that…can you think of anything else that you would recommend?"
"35","  Okay."
"36","  Okay.  And I'm taking notes as well, you’ve highly recommended the shingles vaccine as well as the COVID vaccine and then a general checkup, okay, okay."
"37","  Okay."
"38","  Okay, yeah."
"39","  Alright, well thank you so much for having this visit and I look forward to receiving the information from you in regards to the shingles and the vaccine."
"40","  Okay, thank you and bye-bye."
