"1","  Hey, Mr. Johnson, hi, I believe your microphone is still muted.  It would be great to hear from you."
"2","  Hi, how are you doing Mr. Johnson.  Hi, my name is, I am Jessey Tomkinson.  I am a third-year medical student.  Thanks for chatting with me today."
"3","  How are you feeling today?  I saw that in your note that you have some things going on."
"4","  Okay.  Has anybody that you have been around has had known COVID recently?"
"5","  Okay.  Have you ever had symptoms like this before?"
"6","  Sure.  What kind of symptoms are you currently experiencing?"
"7","  Have you taken your temperature at home?"
"8","  Okay.  Have you been sweating?"
"9","  Have you been having chills or shakes?"
"10","  Have you been having any sensations of feeling cold or warm?"
"11","  Have you needed to wear more or less clothing recently?"
"12","  Okay.  Thanks for answering those questions.  So with the cough and the low-grade fever and the concern of COVID, what are you hoping to accomplish today?"
"13","  Yes, she is obviously worried about you.  Are you worried about yourself?"
"14","  Yeah.  Have you ever had COVID before?"
"15","  Have you taken a COVID test in the past?"
"16","  When was the last time you took a COVID test?"
"17","  Okay.  Have you ever taken a COVID test at home?"
"18","  Do you have any tests currently at home with you?"
"19","  Okay.  Do you have any prior health conditions that I should be aware of?"
"20","  Yeah, have you ever needed to take medication for any reason?"
"21","  Have you ever been told by a doctor or another healthcare provider that you have a diagnosis or a medical health condition that you should be taking medication for?"
"22","  Do you have medical history of asthma?"
"23","  Do you currently smoke cigarettes?"
"24","  Do you smoke marijuana?"
"25","  Have you ever done either of those?"
"26","  Okay.  These are screening questions that we ask everybody to give us a better picture of you and the things that we should either be worried about or not worried about and based on the answers that you provided me it does not sound like we should be worried necessarily about prior smoke exposure since you smoked marijuana at high school that is extremely low risk.  I mean it is reassuring to hear that you not a current smoker, just in consideration of having a respiratory illness potentially like COVID that would make us think of things a lot differently than I do right now.  Is there anything else that you believe I should know that would maybe change decisions?"
"27","  How long is – how long have you been having diarrhea?"
"28","  Three years? Okay.  Is that – was that new for you at that time when it started?"
"29","  Okay.  What is, would you mind describing it.  You know, I am very open to graphic as details as you could, you would prefer?"
"30","  Okay.  You noticed that it is associated with anything going on during the week, maybe something you ate or situational?"
"31","  Okay.  Any recent change to that diarrhea, any change in frequency or consistency?"
"32","  And remind me again how long you have been having the cough with phlegm and fever?"
"33","  Okay.  Well given the nature of the visit today to kind of screen you for COVID I would love to set up a followup visit to talk with you a little bit more in detail about the diarrhea that you have been having for the last three years, but with no recent changes you know it probably is not related to your current cough.  I just have a couple other questions.  In that diarrhea has there been any blood or any other concerning things in it that you have noticed?"
"34","  Okay.  Have you had a colonoscopy?"
"35","  Okay.  Did you have a colonoscopy at that time?"
"36","  Okay.  It is generally something that people don’t forget, so…"
"37","  Yeah, okay.  And since the last time that you have seen the doctor there has been no new changes into your health? I see from your chart here you just take a DayQuil as needed recently for this cough."
"38","  Okay.  Mr. Johnson did you receive any of the COVID vaccinations?"
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Yeah.  Any questions that you have for me currently?"
"41","  Okay.  Well, Mr. Johnson if it is all right with you, I think we are going to have you get set up with a drive-through COVID test, really easy kind of a quick swab and that will give you and your girlfriend some piece of mind as to whether or not this cough that you have been experiencing for the last two weeks is in fact COVID or not."
"42","  Generally, if your tests do come back positive then the most recent guidelines suggest self-quarantine of five days after the positive test or five days after the resolution of symptoms.  So that meaning if your cough were to stop today and we got your tests today, then by let's see Wednesday you would be able to go back to life as normal, but that's really the only ongoing guidance right now.  Do you have any questions about that or concerns?"
"43","  Does that sound like an okay plan to get a COVID swab today?"
"44","  Okay.  And hopefully our clinic can get you a couple at home tests or the United States Postal Service will also send every household a couple of tests so that is also something that you could have on hand in the future if anything were to come up or change."
"45","  Okay.  So our medical assistance will be able to coordinate with you on the phone here about locations and sites to come through and get tested.  Do you have any questions or concerns about getting to the testing site?"
"46","  Okay.  What other questions do you have for me today?"
"47","  All right.  Well, thank you, Mr. Johnson.  I hope you start feeling better.  I am sorry that you have been feeling this way."
"48","  Yes, yes."
"49","  Bye."
