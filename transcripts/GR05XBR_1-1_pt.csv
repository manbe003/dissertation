"1","  Why does it disappear right now?  Just leave it there right?  It is just a secret here.  It is my girlfriend's computer, I mean, I am kind of stymied though."

"13","  Yeah."
"14","  Yeah."
"15","  I think it is kind of certain stuff that is sort off white."
"16","  No, no."

"27","  Yeah."
"28","  No.  You know."
"29","  Nobody complained about it."
"30","  No, not that I know of. I mean, I have not been back there or anything, but nobody has really called me to tell me they have been sick.  I mean, that is what it is.  They want me to go home."
"31","  Yeah, yeah.  It is a bit of a knot, but I mean, I was kind of hoping I could keep it, you know, in the bank."

"33","  I have never been diagnosed."
"34","  No, no, I have not."
"35","  No."
"36","  No."

"44","  It is like I am not being able to work."
"45","  I take NyQuil."
"46","  And that helps me sleep.  Yeah.  I have been resting…I have been sleeping a lot."
"47","  And that is the only thing I have noticed is energy levels are low, sleeping a lot, coughing, got some congestion in my nose."
"48","  Yeah."
"49","  Hmm.  What it?  What is that?"

"54","  Does that burn or anything?"
"55","  Oh, yeah, I will keep it in mind."

"57","  Because, you know, I pulled something in my back at work."
"58","  No, I just did not feel a little compelled to.  I have not been that sick or anything."

"60","  No."
"61","  You know, about that is if I feel thirsty, I take water and then go on.  I keep water around because I am, you know, just to kind of keep myself, you know, irrigated."
"62","  Yeah."
"63","  No, I never do."
"64","  Well….what do I have to do?"
"65","  I have no idea of the closest one."
"66","  This is all like I said, I have not been to a doctor in 10 years.  I have no idea.  I mean, I have got medical insurance and stuff, but I do not really use it that much."

"85","  That is … anything that does not put a camera up my ass, and I am certainly more positive."
"86","  Oh."
"87","  That sounds better than the camera."
"88","  Okay."
