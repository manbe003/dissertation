"1","  Hello Freddy."
"2","  I think we are.  Can you hear me?"
"3","  I am doing well.  Thank you so much for being here.  I recognize this is a little bit of a different platform.  So, if we need to take a break at any point or if anything comes up that’s fine with me."
"4","  My name is David, I am the doctor for today and I understand you’re Freddy."
"5","  Yeah, what do you need to tell me?  What can I help you with today?  I know you are here for some diabetes management and I heard there are some other concerns that you had.  So, I am just curious what we can help you with today."
"6","  You’re here today, thanks so much for being here."
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Okay.  Could you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"9","  Yeah, you have your hands full."
"10"," It seems like they are a lot of fun."
"11","  And it sounds like this is relatively new, you were able to keep up with them in the past, but maybe over the last year or so you feel yourself slowing down?"
"12","  Yeah, that’s entirely reasonable that those thoughts would be stressful and kind of on the back of your mind at all points, especially as you see your grandkids growing up and like you are saying you want to be active and present in their lives and it sounds like that’s really important for you."
"13","  Yeah, so is there anything I know you mentioned that being at work it’s hard for you to be active at work and you feel yourself slowing down towards the end of the day, is there anything that makes it better, are you able to like take breaks at work or have you tried anything or have you taken naps during the day or coffee or anything else at all that kind of makes this fatigue or tiredness get better?"
"14","  Yeah, it sounds great.  I think it’s good that you’re trying to make changes and I bet it’s still discouraging that even trying to walk more and trying to think about what’s going on you’re still struggling with it, but I guess do you have any thoughts about what might be going on or what might be different over the last six months or a year that could be making this tiredness worse?"
"15","  And is that something you talked about with your doctors in the past?"
"16","  Yeah, I was looking over the numbers and they look good, I know it’s your; I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but you kind of felt bad that it’s been a year since you’ve seen a doctor, but your labs looked okay and I want to commend you on the things that you’re doing, taking breaks at work and going on walks and playing with your grandkids, these are all really important things that you’ve been doing.  So, I want to commend you on that before we talk about anything else.  You’re doing what you can."
"17","  Yeah, yeah and so you had mentioned making a change to the medications, is that something that you thought about for a while?"
"18","  Yeah, yeah and you have a notebook with all the numbers each day?"
"19","  Okay and what has it been, is that pretty standard for the last couple of weeks?"
"20","  Okay, okay.  So, it sounds like we could definitely play with the medications during this visit and see how you respond to that over the next couple of weeks.  I would like to check in with you, you know it’s been a year.  I know you were seeing us every four months.  If we make a change today how would you feel about coming back maybe in six weeks or so if we make change to the dosage and then check in a little bit more frequently?"
"21","  Yeah, well like you’re saying it’s my first time meeting you as well.  So, I would like to be able to, if we’re going to make a change to the medications, I would like to be able to see you a little bit more frequently just to check into see how it’s going and obviously just to establish a patient and provider relationship as well.  So, what I am hearing from you, I just want to make sure that I’ve heard you and then we can talk about a plan going forward.  So, it’s been about a year since you’ve seen a doctor about the diabetes and about that same amount of time maybe a little bit less, you just noticed the kind of a gradual decline in your energy levels and your activity and it’s bothering you mostly because you’re not able to keep up with the grandkids, that’s the main issue.  There is obviously it would be good if you would be a little bit more active at work, but the grandkids are the primary motivator and you’ve made some changes to medications in the past, you don’t want to go up to insulin and I can understand that completely.  So, we’re thinking about increasing the dose of one of your medications today and we’ll check back in six weeks.  How does that sound from your perspective?  Is there anything that I missed?"
"22","  Okay, yeah and I know you are taking a couple of medications."
"23","  Yeah, I was looking at the doses, I don’t have them here, but how would you feel about, let’s increase the metformin and how see how that goes?"
"24","  I don’t have the dose."
"25","  Okay, okay, 500 mg twice a day.  Yeah, let’s go up to 1000 mg."
"26","  Twice a day exactly and then we’ll check back in, in a couple of weeks to see how that’s going for you, and one other thing that I am thinking about, we have a whole team here at the clinic, a diabetes nurse and social worker that can help you with anything that might come up in the interim.  I know you are just getting to know the clinic but it might be nice to check in with them and just see, it sounds like you already have the log, you’re pretty familiar with all things diabetes, but it would be nice to establish a relationship with them as well just so we can support you as best as we can."
"27","  Okay, perfect, well again Freddy thank you so much for being here and for trying out this new platform, I know it’s been a lot of changes recently, but it was great to meet you and I hope you have a good rest of your day."
"28","  Perfect and if your name is Freddy, thank you so much for being here."
