"1","  Hi Mr. Johnson.  I can't hear you.  I don’t think your audio connected.  I can't hear you still."
"2","  Yes, sounds good.  Hahaha."
"3","  Good, it worked.  Hahaha."
"4","  Yeah."
"5","  It’s not good.  They always seem to happen sometimes but."
"6","  Yeah, hi Mr. Johnson.  My name is Dr. Hummel and _____ how to pronounce and I will be seeing you today.  Do you prefer to go by Mr. Johnson or another name?"
"7","  Alright.  Nice to meet you Tom.  So, I heard a little bit about what brings you in, but why you tell me kind of what you want to accomplish today."
"8","  Yeah, so, ____ sit back a little bit and see kind of what symptoms exactly are you feeling and for how long?"
"9","  What color is the phlegm that you cough up?"
"10","  Okay.  And have you previously had COVID or had the COVID vaccine?"
"11","  Okay, alright.  Do you have anyone you have been around who have exposed you to COVID?"
"12","  Okay, is your girlfriend feeling ill at all or having similar symptoms?"
"13","  And have you had a fever at all?"
"14","  Okay."
"15","  And any difficulty breathing at all?"
"16","  Do you have any history of any problems with your lungs or any respiratory problems?"
"17","  Okay, alright and kind of wondering if you should get the COVID test today just to see if kind of rule that out and see if that’s what’s causing these symptoms.  Have you been sleeping more at all?"
"18","  And any loss of taste or smell?"
"19","  Okay, alright.  Well, I mean as you probably seen news and everything, COVID is pretty prevalent even if you don’t know a direct exposure and you have some symptoms that to me go and live with COVID, but could be like many other things or could just be seasonal changes or allergies, but I do think that it is appropriate just to get tested, just so we know.  We can confirm or whether you do or do not have COVID, if that works for you?  Easily done today if you’re willing to do that.  We could also send it off for a couple of other respiratory viruses as well.  It is not flu season right now, but you know just with change in patterns, we could test a couple of other viruses at the same time if that works."
"20","  Have you taken any medications for the cold symptoms at all?"
"21","  Does that seem to alleviate any of the symptoms or help or?"
"22","  Okay.  Alright.  And any like sinus pain or sinus pressure?"
"23","  And do you smoke tobacco at all?"
"24","  Okay.  Drink alcohol?"
"25","  Okay.  Smoke marijuana at all?"
"26","  Any other drug use."
"27","  Okay, alright.  So sounds like pretty you have taken good care of your lungs as well.  Hmmm.  Alright.  Was there and you said you haven't been to a doctor in 10 years.  Was there anything else you kind of want to clarify today or kind of get established with care again?"
"28","  Yeah, I think I can come in to take your blood pressure just to check to make sure what you are at with it and also could run some labs that would just take involve like a little stick in your arm to draw some blood and we could run some labs just to check to make sure, things like your sugar and your lipids or like the fatty parts in the blood to see if those are at where we would expect them to be and if they are not then we would call and set up another appointment to see where to go from there with medications or other dietary or lifestyle changes that we would suggest."
"29","  Those are kind of just typical labs that would do just to check on an annual visit and also could be great if  ____ at baseline now, so that hopefully we can establish a relationship and you can come back and you can see how those things change over time."
"30","  Alright."
"31","  Does that sound like an okay plan?  Like we will do the COVID test, we will do some blood work and then like I said we can set you up to send you those results or call you, however, you prefer to communicate as you are going to assume, so….hmmm.  We can do, you know, we have a lot of ways to communicate now, so whatever your preference is, I can send you to the lab for that and like I said reply with those results or you know if you want to start that way?"
"32","  Yeah and those COVID results should be back within 24 hours too so."
"33","  No, not any more."
"34","  We have like a rapid test and then a confirmatory just to double check."
"35","  Oh, it was great to meet you.  Is there anything else I can help with today?"
"36","  Yeah, it’s like it as it sounds is low, low on my suspicion but I still would love to check if you are willing and you know just kind of address all of these."
"37","  Awesome, thank you so much for your time and I will see you later."
"38","  Yeah, bye-bye."
