"1","  Hi Freddie.  I think you are muted.  I can see your mouth moving, but I do not hear any noises.  On the bottom of your screen, do you see a little button that says mute?"
"2","  Yeah."
"3","  Can you see me now?"
"4","  Can you see me, can you see my video?"
"5","  Cool.  I am Jessica.  I am a medical student.  I am working with your doctor today and I will be here to interview you and then all the information I will bring back to my doctor and then we will talk about it and we will come back with your treatment.  Does that sound good with you today? "
"6","  Yes, so I heard you are here for a diabetes visit.  Can you tell me more about that?"
"7","  Hmm..So you have not seen…"
"8","  Yeah.  Are you feeling any different for you to realize that, oh I should go to a doctor today, did anything change?"
"9","  Oh, can you tell me more about that?"
"10","  Is it tired as you cannot stay in anymore or tired that you are going to fall asleep?"
"11","  Fall asleep?"
"12","  Yeah, but just after work you are so tired."
"13","  Yeah."
"14","  Yeah, 2-year-old…"
"15","  Oh, yeah.  And you said this started about six months ago?"
"16","  Do you know that there are life changes, maybe change in the sleep or is this around the time that your wife started taking care of your kids, the grandkids?"
"17","  Oh yeah, okay.  So…"
"18","  Anything, any changes to your medications?"
"19","  No changes you can think of?"
"20","  And have you noticed anything else besides being tired, like maybe feeling shaky, like extra hungry when you do not eat and stuff like that, any other symptoms, maybe headache, dizziness?"
"21","  Nothing.  And how has your diet been, what have you been eating recently?"
"22","  Oh is it?  Nothing changed?"
"23","  And do you check your blood sugars at home?"
"24","  And what are those number at usually?"
"25","  215?  And is that normal for you?"
"26","  Yeah.  It looks like from your date on your chart that your A1c levels have been going up recently.  I guess our last date of appointment was a year ago, so we are not super sure what is wrong, but it is interesting you are getting tired more often."
"27","  Yeah.  Let me see, and your metformin you are taking that twice a day?"
"28","  With your meals?"
"29","  And any side effects, have you, how many doses do you think you have missed in the last month?"
"30","  Okay.  So you are taking most of them?"
"31","  And do you think your diabetes is well managed?"
"32","  Hmm…hmm."
"33","  Okay.  So your nerve pain has gone down, that is really good.  Well, just this tiredness.  Let’s see what else and then, exercise, do you exercise a lot?"
"34","  Uhhuh…And that has not changed since before and after you got tired?"
"35","  Okay."
"36","  Yeah.  Have you started any vitamins or supplements recently?"
"37","  No vitamins or supplements.  And your sleep, how has that been?"
"38","  And you are waking up."
"39","  Hmmm..makes sense.  Oh, okay.  I cannot see any final reason for why you might be feeling more tired recently."
"40","  Umhh…Yeah, sometimes if your diabetes is not in control that can lead to you feeling more tired than you usually would, but when we get the A1c results back, we will see how your diabetes has been since, you have not been to the doctors in a year, we do not actually know how that has been going."
"41","  And is there anything else you wanted to tell me before I go back to the doctor to talk about things?"
"42","  Yeah and it is definitely affecting your life, so hopefully we can find a way to fix it and…"
"43","  And then if it is your diabetes, we are thinking maybe we could increase your metformin, but until we get the results back, I am going to hold off and see what the doctor thinks."
"44","  Yeah, and I hope we can figure this out, because I want you to be able to play with your grandkids after you get back from work."
"45","  Yeah, they really do.  Okay well, that’s it Freddie.  I will go talk to the doctor and come back later, but you are free to go."
"46","  Thanks for coming in."
