"1","  Hello, Freddie, it looks like you might be on mute right now.  So, what you can do bottom left corner you will see a microphone, if you click on that for me?"
"2","  Yes, yes, I very much can."
"3","  So, how are you doing today?"
"4","  Check, oh and sorry I forgot to introduce myself, I am Mike, I am one of the providers here at the clinic.  So, it’s a pleasure to meet you by the way."
"5","  Do you have any questions or concerns before we get going?"
"6","  Sure, okay, so diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago.  Tell me about how things have been going with that?"
"7","  So, tell me a bit more about this tired, at least it sounds like it’s something that’s at normal for you."
"8","  What are their ages?"
"9","  So, quite rambunctious."
"10","  Yeah, if we could ball it up and sell it you know, we would be billionaires.  What is it that you do for work?"
"11","  Okay, and then we’ll circle back on the fatigue but just to check in what medications are you taking, do you remember?"
"12","  Okay."
"13","  Okay, with the metformin 500 mg, is that one pill once a day or?"
"14","  Okay and one or two of those pills, sorry."
"15","  Okay, I get you.  By the way, if it looks like I am looking down on my screen I am just taking notes as we’re talking.  I want to make sure that I remember everything you say."
"16","  Don’t want to miss something.  Okay and so, have you been feeling anything else besides the both low energy, have you been having trouble sleeping?"
"17","  Very true.  Do you have any trouble falling to sleep or staying asleep?"
"18","  And is it roughly the same time each day that you really start to feel that, that kind of ___ of fatigue, no energy?"
"19","  And when you wake up in the morning, do you feel refreshed?"
"20","  Okay and the increased urination, how long has that been going on for?"
"21","  Okay.  So, fair enough.  To go along with that, do you have any trouble starting urine stream?"
"22","  Okay and are you able to hold your urine and make it to the bathroom okay?"
"23","  I am sure ____ as much as we can, and then does it hurt at all when you pee?"
"24","  And have you noticed any changes to the color of the pee?"
"25","  And so along with that, how is your liquid intake been?"
"26","  Yeah, that makes life a bit more difficult.  You want to make sure you stay properly hydrated."
"27","  And how has your health been in the past few months, have you had any illnesses?"
"28","  Okay and have you received the COVID vaccine?"
"29","  Okay and sometimes I saw in the charts and maybe it might have been just something that was added in, but trouble standing for more than two hours, has that been something you have been dealing with?"
"30","  I get you there, okay and I don’t have it in the chart right now, but do you have mom, dad, brothers, sisters who have diabetes?"
"31","  My apologies there."
"32","  How about high blood pressure with them?"
"33","  Yeah, parents or siblings."
"34","  How has your diet been like for example what do you usually eat on a regular day?"
"35","  Sounds quite tasty too.  What’s your go to when it comes to ice cream?"
"36","  I see and then snacks throughout the day?"
"37","  Okay.  And with the soda, what’s your poison there, what you usually like to drink?"
"38","  Okay, all right.  Well, anything else come to your mind that you want to talk about?"
"39","  Sure and I really appreciate your attitude about you know keeping up on that and wanting to do what you can.  So, to be straight up with you the symptoms that you are feeling the increased fatigue, the increased urination those can be signs that the diabetes is starting to have an effect on the rest of the day.  We got a recent, well at least the most recent, A1c which tells us how your blood sugar has been through past three months, it was 7.9 which has been trending up since I believe you are first diagnosed and so that’s a sign for us that you know there is some improvement that can be made.  The medications we have you on right now are solid.  I did see though and maybe again this is just error on our end, that the prescription for metformin was two metformin twice a day, yeah.  I don’t know if you have the pill bottle there or not.  So, you can verify to make sure."
"40","  Okay, perfect, yeah.  So, two in the morning, two in evening and that will be a good first step an easy thing that you can change to help make you feel better.  When it comes to the diet, there are some baby steps that we can take there.  So, with the coffee, cream and sugar, make the coffee taste real good, what are your thoughts about trying something like Splenda?"
"41","  Something along those lines, we certainly don’t have to go back and you know start to back up on Splenda especially you’re peeing more already, don’t want to have you in the bathroom most of the day.  There are a couple of other things that you can try, once that are natural I guess I could say like non-sugar sweeteners a couple of things and I can write these down for you to see you got them when you are finished, one is called monk fruit and then the other is called stevia, both of those are quite sweet but they don’t have the sugar that you get from just plain sugar and those are something, those are couple of things that we can try just to see what we can do there.  When it comes to the large soda at lunch, what your thoughts about switching to diet?"
"42","  I get you and that’s certainly something you know that we want to keep in mind too.  I don’t want you to have to go pee all the time if we switch it to diet."
"43","  Is it something that you feel like you could maybe do every other day?"
"44","  Okay, because I certainly don’t want to cut out the things you enjoy but if we can change it, so that you are taking it a bit less."
"45","  And those are some small steps that we can take now to get your blood sugar in better control and then there is something else I didn’t ask, have are you on fruits and veggies?"
"46","  Okay and it’s hard to sometimes with fruits and veggies to incorporate those into your diet, maybe you talk with the wife if you have time this evening to see thing to see where you could particularly with dinner incorporate a salad or steamed veggies or even sautéed veggies slicing up some broccoli or zucchini throwing a little bit of olive oil in a pan and kind of hand frying them up, it tastes magnificent and it’s something I am sure that the wife would be big on to kind of help make sure that you’re getting in the vegetables too."
"47","  You got a very hardy diet but also one that’s unfortunately not the most healthy for you and with the three little ones, I am sure you want to be around to see them grow up gradually high school."
"48","  Even have great grandkids and I am sure they want you to be around for as long as they can, Freddie too."
"49","  Bowl of ice cream.  Now, I am guilty of this too, I have ice cream on a daily basis.  What I have found to be the key and you can consider trying this as well is using a smaller cup so that way you still get the flavor of the ice cream, you still have the opportunity to eat it but it’s not as big of a certain size, what your thoughts about that?"
"50","  Good, I appreciate you would be willing to do that.  Again, I don’t want to make life miserable for you but we can certainly find a good balance between making sure you get to eat what you want and making sure that your blood sugar stays in a good spot.  And then just to make sure we’ve got all of our bases covered there, what you usually do for any sort of physical activity?"
"51","  I get you.  Well, you would be surprised you know being active with the little ones can burn a few calories.  So, you could certainly count that as activity.  Recommendation when it comes to long term health, they noticed in research that about 20 minutes or so longer exercise so that’s walking at you know a good solid pace everyday, it seems to be pretty effective.  The general rule is you want to get about two hours worth of that sort of exercise a week, most patients I found if they’re able to set aside some time and make it a habit, those are two big things and so it’s fantastic to see that you’re walking.  You are dealing with the fatigue which I totally get and it’s hard to have that motivation, what do you think about possibly talking with the missus and seeing if you and her could set aside sometime in the early evening maybe before dinner to just go for a walk around the neighborhood."
"52","  Well if you want I can write a prescription or I can talk to her directly."
"53","  And then a few other things just for your general health.  So, when it comes to individual who has had you know quite a few birthdays as you certainly have, one of the things that we want to look out for is colon cancer that is something that can, it can pop up and usually pops up in a rather scary fashion which is why we encourage people to have a colonoscopy every 10 years.  It looks like your last one was in 2011."
"54","  If I remember correct."
"55","  And so, it’s not something we have to schedule today but I would certainly encourage you and we can have the referral department call you to get a colonoscopy done."
"56","  Just to make sure that you are healthy when it comes to that."
"57","  And for a few things that we can do today or you can come in tomorrow or the next day is some blood work.  We would like to check an A1c to see how that’s doing you know unless it’s gone super, super high or it’s dropped immensely, I don’t necessarily see it changing any of the plans that we have going forward."
"58","  We would also like to check how your sodium is and how your liver is doing and so we’ll draw what’s called a complete metabolic panel, fancy term for checking all those things."
"59","  And then something else is called the complete blood count or CBC and so I would really like to check that particularly with the fatigue you’re discussing or that you’ve been talking about.  Sometimes it can be just you don’t have as many blood cells as we would want to be able to keep you into top shape and so, just like to check that."
"60","  Something else I know I am throwing a term at you is to have a hepatitis C check.  So, based on when you report there is the idea just to make sure and double-check that you didn’t get infected with hepatitis C during your life, it’s something that we haven’t been checking on people until recently.  It is something that I can just add on to the rest of the labs, they’ll take a little bit of that blood that we draw from you generally.  It’s something that we check once in your life and if you don’t have it fantastic, if you do have it, we’ve got treatments to be able to take care of it before it get serious."
"61","  And then a good old urinalysis.  So, with that one because you’re peeing quite a bit, we want to be able to rule out any sort of urinary tract infection that might be present, it also give us an idea of how your kidneys are doing.  When diabetes starts to gets little bit out of control and a couple of things that will go after first and foremost are your kidneys, all that extra sugar in your body causes the kidneys to not function as well as they can and so that’s another thing that we’re going to want to check."
"62","  And then the good old vaccines.  So, with the COVID vaccine, do you have any questions or concerns when it comes to that?"
"63","  Yeah, at the community you definitely don’t want to be the one to bring COVID."
"64","  It slips through like a firestorm from what I’ve read.  Does your, is your wife vaccinated as well?"
"65","  Okay.  Well, I don’t have to do this all at once but maybe what I just has throw it out there Friday after you get off work, you and her if you go get your first COVIDs and then go get a scoop of ice cream from one of the ice cream shops nearby you know."
"66","  Exactly, do things for your health and then also do little thing for you, make sure that it’s one of those times now that you’ve been good when it comes to sugar intake."
"67","  And another thing so with you having diabetes and then higher blood pressure as well, at least I read that, have you been told that you have high blood pressure?"
"68","  Okay, nice.  When you come to get the blood drawn, I might also suggest to have you get your blood pressure checked, it’s something that they can do quick and easy, if it happens to be high so 130/80 is borderline hypertension into almost hypertension stage 1 with having diabetes, anything that we can do to help keep your blood pressure tolerable is what we certainly want to do.  I am not sure how you feel about starting another medication but there is a medication out there that is fantastic for protecting the kidneys particularly in those who have diabetes, but also helping to lower blood pressure and so if your blood pressure does happen to be a bit high, if you want we can consider starting you on a small dose of this medication.  I could write down the name of the medication and so you can do a little bit of research too if you wants, it’s usually very well tolerated.  One of the only things that people happen to report is that they end up developing kind of this intermittent cough when really there is no other symptoms, but if that’s the case what we can do is we can look up a related medication and I switch it over to that which has similar effect, but doesn’t cause you the cough."
"69","  Certainly.  So, the first one I am thinking of is called lisinopril and that is spelled l-i-s-i-n-o-p-r-i-l."
"70","  The other one is I think it’s valsartan, so it’s v-a-l-s-a-r-t-a-n."
"71","  And usually particularly with insurances, they want us to try the lisinopril first just because it’s cheaper but if you end up developing that cough, we can make a good case to switch it over to the valsartan."
"72","  High blood pressure and also kidney protection."
"73","  Yeah, it’s a two for one deal which is fantastic, which we have more of those in medicine and then one more thing as well on medication that we could consider starting again I don’t want to overload you as you’ve already taking metformin and glipizide but what is called statin, these are medications that we give people particularly to help control their cholesterol."
"74","  Now with your diet, unfortunately particularly with the fried chicken that has a fair bit of fat and cholesterol in it and so one of the things that we want to do is make sure that you don’t have a heart attack anytime in the future.  Let me just…."
"75","  Yeah, no problem, no problem."
"76","  No problem at all.  I was just checking at something.  Yeah, so if you want, there is another website I can give you so that you can check out something, just you can get a better idea, it’s called the American College of Cardiology and it is the ASCVD Risk Estimator."
"77","  And so what this will tell you is it will take into factors, your age that you are male African-American backgrounds, your blood pressure, your cholesterol that you have diabetes and it will tell you your 10-year risk of having a heart attack and so that will kind of give you a better idea of things that we can do to help prevent it and kind of where you stand right now when it comes to a risk and so that was a lot."
"78","  Yeah, if you like we can certainly review.  So, when it comes to diet, what are the things that we’re thinking about changing?"
"79","  Perfect."
"80","  Okay."
"81","  Definitely, yeah.  There is a quite a bit of information out there now even more so if you would like, we could put in a referral for you and her to talk to one of our dieticians, they specialize in diabetes control and managements and honestly their wizards in their knowledge.  Me being a family practice doc, I know a lot about or I know a little about a lot."
"82","  And so, I refer out to those who are experts in some areas and so we can put in a referral there they can give you a call."
"83","  With the metformin.  So, making sure that you’re taking how many pills?"
"84","  Two twice a day, perfect and then when it comes to exercise, what did we talk about?"
"85","  And honestly that’s it is lot and it’s really hard when you’re jumping right into it.  Frankly, what I would recommend starting with five minutes."
"86","  Five minutes every week day maybe take a break on the weekends and as you build the habit, you will be able to add more time to it.  You will be able to start enjoying the weather more, you can take the kids, walk them to a park nearby and just have them go nuts and so then they come back and they’re calmed and you got some exercise in as well."
"87","  And we talked about few things when it comes to screening.  So, things that we’re looking for what you remember there?"
"88","  Yeah, no, all of this is going to be going in not just your medical note but and after visit summary that we’ll send up to you and so one of the big things is colon cancer, looking to do a colonoscopy."
"89","  And then when it comes to vaccinations, what did we talk about?"
"90","  Definitely and I appreciate your insight into that.  It’s fantastic that you’re not only thinking about you and those in your immediate family but also those that you work with, okay.  So, ran through quite a bit, any questions or concerns?"
"91","  It’s my privilege Freddie and we want to have you around as long as we can have you and we’ll just make these baby steps just always keep saying to yourself baby steps.  If you slip up one day that’s okay, tomorrow is a new day for you to be you know for you to do as best as you can."
"92","  And so what I am thinking is we follow up in three months and that will be our next A1c check.  So, we will be able to see how your blood sugar has been with these changes."
"93","  If anything happens in the meantime or if there is anything abnormal when it comes to any of the lab work that we’re going to do, we could see each other sooner."
"94","  And I might send you a message through the Patient Portal or give you a call based on the results but yeah we can look forward to getting those, if not at the beginning of next week towards the later part most of those have a really quick turnaround?"
"95","  Great, fantastic.  Well, I hope you have a good rest of the weekend, Freddie.  I hope you enjoy this, the weather outside."
"96","  You’re welcome."
"97","  Bye."
