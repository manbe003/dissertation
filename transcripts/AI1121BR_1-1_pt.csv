"1","  Hello?"
"2","  Hello, oh."
"3","  Oh, yes, yes."
"4","  Okay."
"5","  Yes."
"6","  Yes, yes.  Excuse me.  Freddie Jones, May 9, 1955."
"7","  May 9, 1955."
"8","  Yes."
"9","  What do you have?  Must be a typo."
"10","  Well, my sugars seem to be elevated lately."
"11","  Well, you know, I have a meter and I can get the green light or I can get the yellow or I can get the red and well I have been in the cautionary zone lately and shows my sugars are elevated."
"12","  Yes, seem like it is running around 215, some up in the 200 teens."
"13","  Well, I have noticed it recently you know?"
"14","  Last couple of weeks."
"15","  Well, not, not really.  You know everybody is busy and the COVID protocols keep changing and you know things are up and down that way, but other than that, I don’t know."
"16","  Oh, they were normal."
"17","  You know I have kept a log, but I didn’t bring it with me today."
"18","  Well, no, no, no.  It hasn’t."
"19","  Well, most of the time."
"20","  Well, I might miss a dose, you know, once or twice every couple of weeks, you know."
"21","  Well, I am taking it like prescribed."
"22","  Oh no."
"23","  Correct."
"24","  Well, you know I have given it a great deal of thought.  I just have no idea."
"25","  Well, I know I was supposed to get in for a checkup every four months or so and I had not been able to for years, so I don’t know."
"26","  Well, I try and take it you know once a week sometimes, you know."
"27","  Well, I eat pretty good, you know.  My wife, she puts the food on the table now, she will put down the steak and potato, you know, so I will crave more, yeah, might even have some fried chicken on the weekend."
"28","  Yes, yes."
"29","  No, pretty much eating the same foods."
"30","  Well, you know, we try to get out and walk a couple of times a week."
"31","  Well, we like to walk longer, but I imagine may be about 15 minutes around the neighborhood, I guess."
"32","  Well, pretty much I guess."
"33","  Oh gosh, we would like to do it every day, but I am just so busy at work.  You know, if I can do it couple of times a week, you know, that’s about all we can do now."
"34","  Well, yeah, yes indeed."
"35","  Well, you know, the paperwork just stacks up, you know I am an administrator in the retirement center and I am telling you with the protocols changing from week to week you never know up from down, you know, with the paperwork keeps going on."
"36","  Oh boy, yes."
"37","  Well, no, I cannot say that I am snacking anymore, I just do not have the time to take a break, you know, I have to eat fast."
"38","  Oh you know, I want to get my sugars under control and it is best if it is medication changes, something like that, well I guess that is something to think about."
"39","  Well, I don’t know if I have any more time to do any more exercises, but I guess I could well, I guess I could check it more often to certain my guess, I don’t know.  I guess it’s worth considering."
"40","  I guess it all sounds like something that could be done, hmmm.  I guess it would be all right to look at my medications I guess."
"41","  Well, I just wanted to, I want to get my sugars under control."
"42","  Well, yes, yes."
"43","  Well, you know, I just seem to be tired all the time.  I have some weakness in my legs."
"44","  Well, when I stand for a time it just feels like my legs are going to give out."
"45","  No, no."
"46","  No, I have not noticed any numbness or tingling.  May be a little something going on in my legs, but that’s about it, I guess."
"47","  Yes."
"48","  No, but sometimes I feel like my legs are going to give out."
"49","  Yes, just feels like I will crumble right down to the ground."
"50","  Well, it generally comes on couple of times a week at least."
"51","  More if I am busy."
"52","  And I am busy."
"53","  I have just have to sit down."
"54","  Well, no."
"55","  I just crumble to the ground."
"56","  No, none at all."
"57","  Seemed to be gradual."
"58","  Yes."
"59","  Say again?"
"60","  Oh my, I was told to come in every four months.  I guess it has been about a year I guess."
"61","  Well, I guess I am going, I have to do that."
"62","  No, I don’t remember that."
"63","  Well, sometime, every few years."
"64","  Say again?"
"65","  No, no, I haven’t had that."
"66","  Well, I think just my views first.  I heard about it.  Do you think that has something to do with my sugars?"
"67","  I see."
"68","  No."
"69","  No, no."
"70","  Well, not in a long time."
"71","  Well, is something to consider, something to consider."
"72","  Well, I just have to make the time.  You know, I am pretty busy."
"73","  Well I guess that’s right."
"74","  No, no."
"75","  Well, I guess it sounds okay."
"76","  Sure."
"77","  Oh, my diet is stable.  My wife, she cooks good."
"78","  Well, you know, I have a couple fried eggs, hash browns, of course you know, couple of pieces of toast with butter and I will have coffee with cream and sugar, you know.  I am on the go so much at lunch I probably grab a double cheese burger I guess, of course I will have a Diet Coke, you know.  You know, in the evenings, you know we are going to get a steak occasionally and steak and potatoes you know and maybe she might even make some mac and cheese or pork chop, you know, the regular stuff."
"79","  Like what?"
"80","  Oh absolutely.  I am on the go, you know, I have to have something fast."
"81","  Well, we keep white bread because you know because you know we got to keep up enough food to make little peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for my grandkids you know.  When I get home from work I would like to have enough energy to play with them, but I am just, my wife looks after them after school, and I am just so tired I can’t keep up with them."
"82","  Yes."
"83","  Oh well you know, they are all right I guess."
"84","  Carb counting, no, never thought about that."
"85","  No.  So is this something new?"
"86","  Oh, I do not know if I have the time to do all that."
"87","  Yes, that sounds pretty tough to me, pretty tough."
"88","  Well, I guess we will have to figure something out."
"89","  Oh, no, no insulin, no."
"90","  Well, it sounds like that could work.  The labs might be all right."
"91","  Well, I hope you can figure something out."
"92","  Yeah, yeah."
"93","  No, no, I just want to get these sugars under control."
"94","  Correct."
"95","  You know, no, I don’t."
"96","  No."
"97","  Well, I guess I can get some supplies and start doing that I guess."
"98","  No, no."
"99","  Oh probably early in the week with work."
"100","  Probably in the morning it would be best."
"101","  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."
"102","  I can try."
"103","  All right."
"104","  All right, okay."
"105","  No, no."
"106","  Okay."
"107","  You are welcome."
