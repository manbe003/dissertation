"1","  Hello, Tom."
"2","  My name is Julie.  It is nice to meet you."
"3","  I am a fourth year medical student and it sounds like you are coming in with some cough and fevers."
"4","  Right, right."
"5","  Is that something…"
"6","  Okay.  Is that something you are concerned about too, as having COVID?"
"7","  Okay, yeah.  Why do not you just start by telling me what you started feeling last week?"
"8","  Hmm, hmm.  Have you had this before?"
"9","   Okay, okay, but it is like something you have had in the past where you get that runny."
"10","  Okay.  And is it feeling like it is getting worse or do you feel like it is actually improving now that it has been a week."
"11","  Kind of the same or worse."
"12","  It is a little worse.  Okay."
"13","  Yeah.  Have you been feeling like you are running fevers or having chills?"
"14","  A little warm, okay.  Do you feel like you are getting like chills?"
"15","  That is fair.  That is fair.  Maybe not particularly feeling chills or anything."
"16","  Okay.  And in terms of your cough, do you feel like, you are coughing up stuff or is it pretty dry?"
"17","  Okay, okay and when you look at it like, is there a color to it or…"
"18","  Off white, okay, any blood when you are coughing. "
"19","  Okay, alright.  And then the runny nose, same thing, do you feel like it is kind of snotty or is it pretty liquidy?"
"20","  Okay.  Hear just like what?  (Laughs)"
"21","  Hmm.  That is fair, that is fair.  And are you having chest pain?"
"22","  Okay.  Is it like painful to breathe in and out?"
"23","  Okay.  And do you feel like you are more tired than usual?"
"24","  Okay.  Alright.  And then how has your appetite been?"
"25","  Any changes in your appetite the past week?"
"26","  Okay, okay.  Anything make your symptoms better or worse?"
"27","  Nyquil and DayQuil.  Has those been helping at all?"
"28","  All equals (laughs)."
"29","  Okay.  Helps you sleep.  Any like other medications that you have tried?"
"30","  Okay.  And then what are medications you take regularly?"
"31","  Nothing, Okay.  Any like sick contacts you have been around recently?"
"32","  Okay."
"33","  Mentally, some?"
"34","  Okay, kind of just interpersonal things rather than physically ill."
"35","  Okay, okay.  So, it sounds like you have kind of had this like week long of coughs, runny nose.  You are kind of concerned that it might be either an upper respiratory thing like a cold, your girlfriend is concerned it might be COVID.  Are you up for a COVID test?"
"36","  You write it out (laughs)."
"37","  Yeah, have you gotten your COVID vaccine?"
"38","  Okay, not interested?"
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Hmm, hmm.  Well, it does not sound like you are having like you are seriously bothered or concerned about this cough.  Would you be agreeable to getting a COVID test to see to rule that out?"
"41","  I can check your insurance plan.  I am not super familiar with insurance coverage myself."
"42","  Hardly ever use, yeah."
"43","  Yeah, let us see.  Would that be something you would want to check before agreeing to any tests?"
"44","  Oh, yeah, okay.  So, that is something that I can check then I can like see if your insurance would cover that or how much that would be and then if it was covered, is that something you would want to get?"
"45","  The COVID test?"
"46","  We should be able to just do it in office or if you can go in, they just take a swab of your nose."
"47","  Sounds pretty simple if that is covered or if that is something newer."
"48","  That is totally understandable."
"49","  Yeah, that is very understandable, especially if it is something you feel like you can ride out. I get that (laughs)."
"50","  Okay, that sounds good.  That is something we can offer you and then in terms of symptoms, I would say we can, you can continue taking things that help you feel better, so if the DayQuil and NyQuil help you, if you feel like you have fevers, Tylenol is a great option.  If you do feel like it is like within the next few days to a week, you still are not getting better and you are getting worse, I would make another appointment and go in just in case we are missing something or if that infection is just not going away.  Does that sound reasonable?"
"51","  (Laughs) okay.  And then of course hygiene, clean hands and hopefully limiting contact as much as you can.  I know you sounded busy, but anything helps."
"52","  Alright.  Does that sound pretty reasonable?  I can check in about the COVID testing.  You can continue over-the-counter things unless you really feel over the next week things are getting worse."
"53","  Yeah, I do not see anything in your chart right now (laughs)."
"54","  (laughs), right.  Sounds like she really cares about your health."
"55","  10 years is a long time.  Were you interested in establishing care?"
"56","  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Yeah. Well, I can also take, you know, especially just getting like a history of medical conditions you have had in the past.  Anything we should know?  For example, have you been diagnosed with diabetes that you know of, heart disease, anything in your family history like cancers?"
"57","  Oh, yeah, I am sorry to hear that.  Do you know type of cancer? "
"58","  Okay, okay."
"59","  Breast cancer, great, and it sounds like she passed away."
"60","  Alright.  And do you know what she passed away from?"
"61","  Not really sure?"
"62","  Okay, what about your father?  Anything on your father's side that we should know of?"
"63","  Okay.  And also, especially when we are establishing first time patients, I want to ask about any substance use like alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana?"
"64","  Okay."
"65","  Okay, how much beer do you drink in a week?"
"66","  Two a night, every night?"
"67","  Okay. And two like cans or two bottles?"
"68","  Okay.  And you said, no smoking.   Any other substance use, cocaine?"
"69","   Okay, alright.  And how it sounds like you are not taking any medications aside from over-the-counter ones when you need them."
"70","  Okay.  Alright.  And then also in terms of mental health questions like to ask about any like feelings of depression, hopelessness."
"71","  Okay, any thoughts of harming yourself or others?"
"72","  Okay.  And it sounds like you have a partner.  Any children?"
"73","  Okay.  Do you live with your partner or alone?"
"74","   Okay, in a house or apartment?"
"75","  Are you from the Seattle area?"
"76","  Nearby, nearby."
"77","  Alright.  Born and raised in this area, then?"
"78","   Okay and what do you do for work?"
"79","  General labor, okay.  How long have you been doing that for?"
"80","  Hmm, a long time then?"
"81","   Alright.  Umm, alright.  Well, thank you for sharing all of that.  You know, it is a lot of basic questions.  Due to like because you have not had a like a doctor visit in a really long time with giving, it looks like you are 58, is that right? "
"82","  Okay, given kind of that age group, there are a few things we like to screen for and basic stuff we can get like that would require like a lab draw.  Is that something that you are interested in getting?"
"83","  Yes, so there are like certain things that we like to test for and so we can check for things in your blood, like your cholesterol level, your electrolyte level like sodium, potassium, and sugar levels.  There are also other things we can check like for example, right now you might have an infection and so we can also see that in your blood results as well."
"84","  You would be interested in?"
"85","  Yeah, you have to…"
"86","  Right.  You would not do it yourself.  (Laughs) It would be a lab draw. Yes.  So you go in, they draw your blood, and then we can do a basic like just get a baseline of where you are at in terms of like cholesterol and sugar levels and whatnot and we can kind of go from there just to see where you are at. I know you (laughs) you sound very enthused about this."
"87","  I know."
"88","  Hmm.  That is understandable and also what I can do is like put in these orders and you can come in when it is convenient for you since it would not be attached to a visit."
"89","  Oh, I know.  It is not the most fun thing to go through, but usually they are really quick.  There is also other screenings that we offer, so there is colon cancer screening, which does require either a stool test or a colonoscopy, so that would be a camera going through your bowels.  Are you interested in either of those?"
"90","  Yeah (laughs)"
"91","  Yes, yeah.  So, there is a stool test option which you can, you can send a sample of your stool and they can just to screen for colon cancer and the other option would be to do the full colonoscopy."
"92","  Essentially, those are the two options they are looking at (laughs).  It is recommended and it is pretty helpful in terms of, especially if you have never had one yet."
"93","  And you can definitely take time to think about it.  Yeah, there is no urgency for that."
"94","  I know there are a lot of things to catch up on with 10 years without a doctor's visit."
"95","  Hmm, hmm.  I know and we can take it step by step too.  We do not have to do this all at once or make any decisions right now."
"96","  Yeah.  Any other questions you had about anything we covered, I know it was kind of a lot."
"97","  So, it sounds like right now, the main thing is I will check in about the COVID test and let you know if that is something you are interested in getting and then getting those lab results from your blood draw just to get a baseline and we can go from there.  I will touch base with you about any other screenings after you have some time to think about it."
"98"," It is about the colon cancer screening."
"99","  (laughs) Okay.  And again if you are feeling worse definitely you can always go into urgent care ER if you really feel like your cough is getting really bad."
"100","  Okay.  Do not want to miss any infections."
"101","  (laughs).  Does that sound okay?"
"102","  Yes, of course, it was lovely meeting you."
"103","  Of course, alright, I think now I can let you leave, I am not really sure."
"104","  That sounds good."
"105","  Nice to meet you."
