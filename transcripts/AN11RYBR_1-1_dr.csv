"1","  Hello."
"2","  Pretty good.  Is it Freddy?"
"3","  Hi, Freddy, my name is Enis Marshall, and I am going to just be talking to you today about what’s going on.  How are you feeling?"
"4","  Yeah.  Could you tell me a little bit more about that I can hear you are coming in today for just to talk about your type 2 diabetes?"
"5","  Okay.  Yeah, well we can definitely talk about that.  I just want to check for not coming to the doctor now over a year, is there anything that like has been hindering you from coming?"
"6","  Yeah, I understand that, okay.  Well, in your notes I noticed that you had increased fatigue over the last six months.  Can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"7","  So, when you feel the fatigue, is it brought on by anything?"
"8","  Okay, and so when you take these breaks, do you feel little bit better or do you kind of still feel the same where you’re not like, stuff like that?"
"9","  Feel the same, okay, okay and are there any other symptoms that you’re feeling, do you ever feel any like lightheadedness when you feel tired?"
"10","  Okay, okay.  And as far as your medications, I saw that you’re taking metformin as well as glipizide, have you been taking those pretty consistently?"
"11","  And when you miss the dose, do you feel any different?"
"12","  Okay, okay and I guess I want to dive a little bit more in because I have noticed that you also haven’t had a lipid pill in a while and you might also be having some of the hyperlipidemia.  So, just with that, are you ever feeling any type of chest pain or anything on exertion or not exertion any changes?"
"13","  Okay."
"14","  Okay, okay, and so you said that taking a break doesn’t make you feel any better and how long do you think that the fatigue last?"
"15","  Right. And I also noted that you have had some trouble standing, can you tell me a little bit more about that?"
"16","  And so what the trouble standing, is it because you’re tired or is it because like something else like pain that you’re having?"
"17","  Okay, all right.  So, all kind of looped into that, okay and I think it will be important today that we at some point also get your A1c levels checked out again and see if they kind of have been trending up a little bit.  So, we want to see how your medications have been working to kind of bring that down and whether or not they’re the most effective.  How do you feel about your medications right now?"
"18","  Okay and just along the same lines, like do you have any other concerns about like weight or like cost or anything that would kind of like that will help you figure out kind of what area to go for the medications, do you have any concerns?"
"19","  Okay, all right and I think it’s also important as well like what is for managing diabetes, is like exercise and diet.  Can you tell me a little bit about your, first your exercise, do you feel like you’re getting that in?"
"20","  Okay, that’s good, it’s good to get some exercise in.  And you said how often do you get to do that?"
"21","  Okay, and do you go alone or is there somebody like joins you when you’re walking?"
"22","  Okay, that’s good.  It’s good to have that like someone is walking with you."
"23","  And then as far as you diet, how would you describe that?"
"24","  Okay.  So, sounds like you’re definitely getting some protein in with your eggs, and from what that needs, do you feel like you’re getting some of your other food groups…, sorry?"
"25","  Okay, yeah I can see how, like if you are relied on somebody to make the food, then you are like kind of determined what you are going to eat.  Do you think that she would be open to incorporating some of the other food groups in like, you know maybe adding some green leafy vegetables in your diet?"
"26","  Yeah, I know how that goes trying to suggest what someone should cook, okay well, I think some of the things that I am hearing in like thinking that you might want to try to incorporate is some of the more leafy greens.  So, if your wife isn’t open to it, maybe you might be open to it like instead of getting a double cheese burger during lunch, maybe instead you might get a salad or something like that to try to balance something out.  Would you be open to anything like that?"
"27","  Yeah, okay, well it’s good to start thinking about it and like we’ll be here, ___ away if you want to do, if you do want to ever talk to like a nutritionist or a dietician about like trying to incorporate some of those things and even like possible food services to help you out with that, but I just want to ask if there is anything that we haven’t talked about today that would be something that you think I should know or that is also concerning you?"
"28","  Okay.  Well as far as what I think we should do today, so I think we should get a lipid screening again because it looks like you are kind of overdue for that.  So, we just want to check out to see if like levels of your lipids so like your HDL versus your LDL which is you definitely want to start have like a higher HDL than LDL.  So, we want to look at that as well as your cholesterol levels.  I think we also want to get your A1c level because we did see like a little bit of a trend up.  So, I think that will help us determine like you know if your medication is working correctly and then from there likely my looking like I said looking to different medications some other options that might help with lowering your A1c as well as like helping with your hyperlipidemia. I think I might also recommend starting something that helped with your hyperlipidemia which would be a simvastatin and we can talk a little bit more about dosage, but how is that sounding to you?"
"29","  Yeah, do you have any reservations about what I am saying?"
"30","  Okay and any questions?"
"31","  Okay.  Well, thank you Freddy for coming in today.  It’s been wonderful speaking with you and I hope that we can get those labs done and then we can meet again maybe in about three weeks or so."
"32","  Okay, that sounds good, great.  Well, have a wonderful day."
"33","  Bye."
