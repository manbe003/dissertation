"1","  Hi, hi."
"2","  Oh not bad, not bad."
"3","  Well, I have been checking on my diabetes.  I was supposed to, I was supposed to go over a few months or so, but I haven’t been to a doctor in a year, so I am a little concerned."
"4","  I just, I am just so damn tired all the time though."
"5","  Well, I first, I noticed it about maybe six months ago, something like that.  I was playing with my grandkids because my wife takes care of the kids while their parents are at work and so they are around a lot.  They are just cute, you know?  So, I spends some time playing with them and then I was becoming a bit more tired and tired me out.  So, I started to worry about that and just in terms of my energy levels and it has gotten a little worse over time."
"6","  Oh, nothing I recall."
"7","  No that is about it."
"8","  No."
"9","  No."
"10","  Well, I have been busy."
"11","  My mood has been about the same, I guess.  I have good days, bad days, yeah, pretty much the same."
"12","  No."
"13","  No, not really, it isn’t --I haven’t caught my -- I haven’t been short of breath or nothing.  But it’s just general fatigue, I guess.  I just, even at work I just feel like taking nap."
"14","  Oh, good six or seven."
"15","  Pretty much, pretty much.  For some reason that’s the day it’s the day that I get careless sleep, but I don’t know.  Since I am, done my whole life, so I don’t think that much of it."
"16","  I do.  You would have to ask my wife."
"17","  She doesn’t complain about it, but you know…"
"18","  Not, not bad anyway, you know?"
"19","  Oh no, no."
"20","  No, no."
"21","  I do not actually, I don’t recall if I have had one."
"22","  From what I hear about it, ______ from this."
"23","  I am just thinking, okay, clear if anything else is going on, no it’s pretty much the same thing.  It’s just, the thing that is bothering me is my energy levels."
"24","  Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"25","  Not every day, about twice a week."
"26","  Last time I did it was this morning, actually it was 215."
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Well, it has been creeping up, because I know, it’s in yellow."
"29","  Not more, I urinate a lot."
"30","  No."
"31","  Oh, boy, you know, I have not thought a clock in that.  If I were to guess, I would say about three or four.  Okay?"
"32","  Yeah."
"33","  No, no."
"34","  Okay."
"35","  Okay.  Yes, I can do more medication, yeah."
"36","  ______."
"37","  Okay."
"38","  Oh okay, yeah."
"39","  Yeah, that sounds good."
"40","  No, I don’t think so.  So it’s something, I don’t know.  I thought about taking, about drinking some coffee in the afternoon kind of put it myself up and then I would not, and that I couldn’t fall asleep at night and I wake up, so I wake up."
"41","  Maybe it is six and seven, okay I will just mention seven.  I just don’t do eight really because I get restless."
"42","  Oh, oh, okay I didn’t know about that.  Okay I will ask her about that."
"43","  Okay, thank you."
"44","  Okay.  Nice to have met you."
