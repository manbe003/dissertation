"1","  Hi, Freddie or hi, Mr. Jones.  I think you are muted.  I think if you go to, let me.  I still cannot hear you.  I think if you go to the bottom part of your screen, there will be a little microphone and you can click that.  Yeah, it looks like you clicking."
"2","  Yes."
"3","  Perfect.  Hi, Mr. Jones."
"4","  I am Fernanda.  I am going to be the provider helping you out today."
"5","  So, I hear that you are here for a routine diabetes visit."
"6","  And can you tell me more about what brings you in?"
"7","  Okay."
"8","  For how long have you been feeling this way?"
"9","  Okay."
"10","  Okay and by tired, what do you mean by that?  Have you been sleeping more or just kind of let me know how you are feeling?"
"11","  _______."
"12","  And when is the last time that you have had, you have been screened for your age? Your A1c and your diabetes."
"13","  It can be hard, especially with everything that has been going on lately, but glad to see that you are taking next step to do that today, so let us take advantage of that."
"14","  Besides you feeling kind of fatigued for the past 2-3 months, any other symptoms?"
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Tell me how you have been doing, what medications are you taking for your diabetes?"
"17"," Okay"
"18","  And how are you taking them?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Yeah, I want to see kind of like if you take it, how many pills a day are you taking of each one and at what times of the day? And if you take them with any food, anything like that?"
"21","  Okay, which one do you take once a day?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay.  So you only take two pills a day."
"24","  Okay.  I see here that on the metformin, it is 500 mg twice a day with meals."
"25","  Have you been doing, are you sure that you have been taking just one pill versus two?  That is okay.  You can just tell me what you have been taking."
"26","  Okay.  And it says how many milligrams again, sorry, I just want to sometimes diabetes medications, it can be very tricky."
"27","  You know, what I have is the same with what you are taking."
"28","  So tell me, what _______ the metformin? How many?"
"29","  And how do you take the 2000 mg? Like how do you get to the 2000 mg in one day?"
"30","  Okay, and then tell me about the glipizide.  How many milligrams does your prescription bottle make?"
"31","  And you get that one once a day."
"32","  Okay.  Umm.  Okay.  Well.  What I have here is different, so it is not to say like you are wrong or I am wrong or anything like that, but with that it kind of makes me worried that maybe some of your symptoms may be from having really high blood sugar or maybe really low blood sugar."
"33","  _______ with you telling me that you have been pretty fatigued"
"34","  Okay.  Have you been checking your blood sugars?"
"35","  Right.  Can you tell me what was the measurement from this morning?"
"36","  215.  Is that kind of where they? Where it is at in the morning every day."
"37","  Okay, and when do you get dizzy?"
"38","  No, you do not get dizzy, but when you get fatigued, I am sorry."
"39","  Okay.  Have you noticed that this, the fatigue changes if you eat a meal? Or if you drink something?"
"40","  Okay, and about how many meals a day are you consuming?"
"41","  And have you been having any changes in your vision?"
"42","  Any headache or?"
"43","  Any trouble speaking?"
"44","  Yeah."
"45","  What about swallowing?"
"46","  Any shortness of breath?"
"47","  Chest pain?"
"48","  Stomach pain?"
"49","  Any dizziness?"
"50","  Any, any trouble walking or standing?"
"51","  And have you noticed any numb patches of your body or tingling?"
"52","  Okay.  And how often do you, you said that you take your blood sugar once a day, is that correct?"
"53","  I am just looking at the records to see where your A1c was usually at."
"54","  Oh, no worries.  Okay.  Well it looks like from this appointment, it can be really kind of hard to figure out why you have been more fatigued, and it would be helpful to get blood work to be able to check what your A1c levels are and also to check other things that could affect you kind of be feeling fatigued, like your thyroid.  Umm and other, other levels since you have not been here or been to the doctor in a while now.  Would you be open to doing coming in for blood work?"
"55","  I think it would be a good idea.  It does not, right now it just you know, I cannot give you a clear reason as to why, why you have been feeling more fatigued, but certainly getting those routine labs would be helpful."
"56","  I would also like to talk about how you have been taking this metformin and the glipizide and what I have is just is different.  However, I do not want to change it too much since you have been kind of feeling like this for the past six months.  I donâ€™t, I am not sure until you get blood work whether I want to go one direction or the other.  Does that make sense?"
"57","  So, is there a way for you to come get blood work soon, like tomorrow?"
"58","  Early next week."
"59","  Okay.  In the meantime, I think then I would want if it is possible for you to write down take your blood sugars more often, maybe like even two, two times a day if possible."
"60","  So before your meal and then even after you eat."
"61","  Okay.  Hmm.  Yeah.  So, I want you to check your blood sugars more often and kind of write them down on a piece of paper, so we can, we can talk about it.  Hmm, hmm and until then, I mean I give you kind of, I mean I can send you a worksheet over, so you can see where, actually I have a change of thoughts.  Do you have like MyChart or able to message me what your blood levels are tomorrow?"
"62","  Yes, okay, perfect.  So let's do that.  So, you continue what you have been doing and with the, with the same medications you have been doing, the same timing, the same dosing, but just take your blood sugar more often and let me know what those numbers are, and we can go from there. Okay?"
"63","  I can send you a worksheet once I know where those at, where I kind of want your blood sugars to be "
"64","  With that range.  And then we can get you closer to that range until you get your blood sugar appointment and you get some lab work done with us next week. "
"65","  I would, yeah, I do not want to keep everything completely the same until I see you for that blood work.  Okay?"
"66","  So we will make those little adjustments.  Hmm.  Any questions for me right now?"
"67","  About what, I am sorry."
"68","  Yeah."
"69","  Yeah. Well, it is a, it is a, it is a great question.  It could be you just being tired or it could be something, something more but at this point, there is like not a good way to know."
"70","  And I, I would not want you to worry for no reason.  So, the first step would be for you to just get that blood work and then we can talk about you know, getting kind of your health maintenance up to date and making sure your medications are, you know, doing some fine tuning of everything."
"71","  And then we can go from there.  I feel like that is, that is a way that is helpful.  I see it is helpful most of the time for patients to just take one step at a time"
"72","  Because then it kind of can sometimes bring unnecessary worry and sometimes harm to just let our heads wander for no good reason sometimes, okay, so you can just take that first step.  How does that sound for you?"
"73","  Yeah."
"74","  Hahaha.  Okay.  So let us do that.  I will send you or send me those upcoming blood sugars, and then I will send you a chart, so then we can kind of fine tune things before you get your next blood draw, okay?"
"75","  Okay, alright.  Thank you so much."
"76","  Have a _______"
