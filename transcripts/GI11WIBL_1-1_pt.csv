"2","  Yes.  Tom, please."
"3","  Hi, Megan."
"4","  Okay."
"5","  Okay."
"6"," That's right.  That's right."
"7","  Well.  My girlfriend wants me, I guess, to be checked out from head to toe, you know."
"8","  She is a worrier."
"9","  Well, yeah to get her off my back, I guess so."
"10","  Well, you know, it has been a while since I've been in.  I've had this cough for about a week or so now, and well, like you say, I've been a little warm.  So I guess if I have any concerns, that's it."
"11","  Yeah, I guess that's alright."
"12","  Oh! "
"13","  Correct."
"14","  Yeah.  We all have been feeling warm, I guess, but I'm a little more warm than usual."
"15","  Yeah, about the same time."
"16","  Well, I have had this cough."
"17","  No.  I just know myself, you know, and I feel my head and I know when I'm a little warm."
"18","  Well, a little bit of both."
"19","  Yes."
"20","  I've had a little diarrhea, but I've had that forever, off and on."
"21","  Yeah."
"22","  Hmm, not that I know of."
"23","  Yeah, my girlfriend.  That's why I'm here."
"24","  She wanted me to come here.  I don't know why, but I'm here."
"25","  Well, she's been back there pushing me and so here I am."
"26","  Do you think I can _______."
"27","  Yeah, lower _______."
"28","  My energy level has been way low, way low."
"29","  Yes."
"30","  Thank you."
"31","  All of the above."
"32","  Well, when I can sleep."
"33","  Well, with the cough and the heat, you know, just sort of keeping me awake."
"34","  Well I get, you know, a coughing jag but I get that tickle in my throat."
"35","  Well, just lately the same could be happening when I'm sleeping."
"36","  But it happens throughout the day."
"37","  Off and on."
"38","  Well, I took some of that over-the-counter stuff to help with the cough and help me sleep.  I forget the name of it, but I got it at Rite Aid."
"39","  Yeah."
"40","  Well, a little bit."
"41","  Only works for a short time."
"42","  Well, guess it's been 8 or 10 years, but they said everything was normal and I was fit as a fiddle."
"43","  Yes, yes."
"44","  No, no."
"45","  No, no, can't say that I have."
"46","  Oh!"
"47","  No."
"48","  Well, we've been working half-days lately, the last few days and I am in construction."

"50","  Yes, yes.  See those cranes rolling?"
"51","  Hmm.  Not that I know of;"
"52","  Yeah, you know, we wear the N95 all day.  That's the other thing.  My girlfriend wants me to have that COVID test."
"53","  Hmm."
"54","  Well, yeah, for getting my girlfriend off my back.  Yeah, yeah, let's do it."
"55","  Well, I have to stay off the job for sure."
"56","  Well, I guess I wouldn't have another choice."
"57","  No, I guess not."
"58","  Well, we get tested occasionally on the job."
"59","  Like _______ CDC and all that."
"60","  Random."
"61"," No, I don't."
"62","  Well, it wasn't that long ago, I guess.  I don't remember."
"63","  None that I know of."
"64","  Oh, no, no."
"65","  Very unusual."
"66","  Been fit as a fiddle until now."
"67","  Oh, good, good."
"68","  No, no."
"69","  I haven't been sick until now."
"70","  No.  I haven't had the COVID vaccine."
"71","  Well, after the test maybe something to think about."
"72","  Oh, well, yeah, that sounds fair."
"73","  No, no."
"74","  Well, some of the guys on the job been going to the drugstore to the Safeway.  I guess they're out there."
