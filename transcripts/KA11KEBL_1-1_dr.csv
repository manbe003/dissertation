"1","  Hi, there.  Oh, I don’t think I can hear you.  I think you're muted."
"2","  Okay, I can hear you now."
"3","  Hi, my name is Ash.  I use he/him pronouns.  I am a first-year medical student and I’ll be doing your interview today and you are?"
"4","  Okay. And Freddy, how would you like me to refer to you?"
"5","  Okay, any pronouns you would like to use?"
"6","  Okay, thank you.  So, what brings you in today?"
"7","  Okay.  Is everything all right?"
"8","  Uh-huh."
"9","  Yeah, I’m sorry you had to deal with that.  That definitely makes it very challenging to want to go back and receive care but I’m glad you came back.  So, you’ve mentioned that you’ve been feeling more tired over the past few months and that your numbers have gone up and I did see that your hemoglobin A1c has been trending up, I don’t know if you are aware of that?"
"10","  Okay. So, how do you feel like your diabetes control is going?"
"11","  Yeah, I was going to say, how do you feel like your control or like the control of your diabetes is going?"
"12","  Are you not able to hear me?"
"13","  Okay, thank you.  So, besides feeling tired, has anything else been going on, anything that you've noticed out of the blue?"
"14","  Okay."
"15","  Okay.  Do you feel like you’re peeing more now than you were few months ago?"
"16","  Okay, no worries.  So, I saw that you are on two medications.  You are on metformin and I believe the other medication was glipizide?"
"17","  Okay and how has it been taking those?"
"18","  Well, I am glad that you’re not having that anymore and you know everyone misses doses every now and then but I am glad that you’re able to take it consistently.  Have there been any issues like getting access to the medication or anything like that?"
"19","  Okay."
"20","  Okay and any side effects that you’ve noticed since starting the medications?"
"21","  Okay and then I know this is kind of hard because since this was an issue with your last provider but like with diabetes diet does pay a large role.  So, I’m not going to harp on about like changing your diet but I just want to learn about your diet since this is my first time meeting you."
"22","  Sorry, so if you could just tell me about your diet, I just want to learn more since this is my first time meeting you?"
"23","  And that all sounds really good.  You mentioned that with your past doctor there was an issue about changing your diet, what were some diet changes that you were asked to make or you have made?"
"24","  Yeah, of course.  So, with the diet thing we can like table that for now and revisit it later. Let’s ask about, I am going to ask about your blood sugars, how often do you check the blood sugars?"
"25","  Okay and how have they been running?"
"26","  Okay and how long have they been climbing up or when you did you notice that increase?"
"27","  Yeah."
"28","  Yeah."
"29","  Yeah and that’s definitely important and I know it’s a big step to even come after you had a bad experience so I think you should be proud of yourself for being able to come back and make an appointment after that last encounter, so."
"30","  Yeah, I am sorry about that, I’m just, there is a classroom next to me and there are people in there."
"31","  And then so you are checking your blood sugars a couple of times a week, have you heard about like a continuous glucose monitor before?"
"32","  Okay, so what that basically is like a monitor that you kind of like inject and it has a little needle and you just wear it and like always it checks your glucose every 15 minutes and we can like keep track of the patterns of your blood sugar, that’s a good new thing.  So, instead of having like poke yourself every day, multiple times a day, just check your blood sugar, it automatically checks it for you and this way we get more readings and like we can keep track of the patterns of your blood sugar like, okay are they increasing, are they decreasing and it can help us potentially better manage your diabetes."
"33","  I think it might just hurt once you’re putting it in because it’s like a little poke but it goes in for like two weeks, so instead of poking yourself in your finger like three times a day or like every couple of weeks every like three times a week, it could just be once and that’s it."
"34","  Yeah, that’s something for you to consider like if not like – do you feel like since you check your blood sugars few times a week, do you feel like that’s just because like you forget or this is like what is it the barrier for checking your blood sugar every day?"
"35","  Yeah, I think this will just be helpful because your blood sugar because you’re getting these readings a few times a week but our blood sugar fluctuates throughout the day depending on the time of the day, if we’re eating, if we’re not eating.  So, it would be good to track these blood sugars throughout the day just to see how they’re changing instead of over like few a points over a week, they will have a lot of points over the day which is more data for us and we can make a better plan suited for you."
"36"," And then we can consider ordering that and then you can do that so we can keep track of your glucose sugar levels. And now coming back to the diet, I don’t want to have to like completely change your diet because obviously that does not work. How would you feel about like maybe like cutting back on something or like maybe like making substitutes for something?"
"37","  That’s better than nothing.  So, like you mentioned like maybe taking more skin off the fried chicken so maybe things like that, like instead of having like two or three scoops of ice cream you have like one and one and half or just like if you are not getting rid of these things completely because they are part of your life and bring you joy but maybe just cutting back since like you do know that they are impacting your sugars."
"38","  So, we can just start like with just like little cutbacks on the things that you are already having and just like cutting back a little bit and seeing how you feel with that."
"39","  Yeah and it’s completely up to you and then with the glucose monitor we can keep track of your data and see since you’re having these 215 readings is there other gaps that we’re missing in your blood sugar that we're not getting since they’re being checked only a few times per week."
"40","  Yeah, so I think at this point since it’s been a while since you’ve seen someone we should plan to gather more data.  So, we’re going to get the glucose monitor, we’ll check your A1c again just to keep track of it since we’ve been keeping track of that fairly consistently.  We can do some basic blood work but for now we’ll just plan on gathering more data and then maybe think about potentially cutting back on some things like a little bit in moderation here and there and then check back to see, look at the data and then see if there is any improvements if you are able to cutback or moderate and kind of like make a plan there that works for you."
"41","  Okay.  Let’s see and then have you been sick at all recently?"
"42","  Okay.  Do you have any other questions or concerns for me?"
"43","  Okay, well thank you so much for coming in and I am glad you came back to us."
"44","  Yeah, so I will see you on your next visit."
"45","  You too."
