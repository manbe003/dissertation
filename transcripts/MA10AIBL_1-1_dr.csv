"1","  Yeah, yeah."
"2","  Yeah, done."
"3","  Cool."
"4","  Hello Mr. Downes, can you hear me?  I'm not able to hear you, are you able to turn your mute off in the bottom left hand corner of your screen?  There we go."
"5","  Cool, you can hear me?"
"6","  Okay, great.  It looks like on my screen it's a little glitchy, but sometimes that can happen over a telehealth visit, so we'll work with what we got."
"7","  How are you doing so far today?"
"8","  That's great, it's good to hear.  I saw in your chart that you're here for your diabetes followup regular checkup, is that right?"
"9","  Yes, yes, I'm glad you are here.  What sort of concerns do you have regarding your diabetes today?"
"10","  Yeah, that's super reasonable.  I think I saw in your chart that you're also having trouble just standing, is that right?"
"11","  Okay.  So just to your confirm, we're here for a regular diabetes checkup.  You've been having some increased fatigue for about half a year or so and then and looking at your most recent A1c levels, it looks like the last time you were in, in 2021 it was at 7.9, does that sound right?"
"12","  Okay.  And the first think I'm curious about is, how you think you've been doing with your diabetes management?"
"13","  And what medication is that, do you just, go head, yes."
"14","  Okay, good.  And how about diet, how has that been?"
"15","  Yeah."
"16","  Okay.  And what your exercise habits look like during this time?"
"17","  Yeah, that's pretty good though.  Recommendations are 150 minutes per week.  So if you're getting 10 to 15 minutes twice a day, then you're definitely hitting that, that's pretty good.  Next thing I'm curious about is have you been keeping track of your blood sugars?"
"18","  Okay, so 215 in the morning.  How about do you have like a midday or after dinner?"
"19","  Okay.  So kind of going forward, I'm curious how you feel about your management of your diabetes right now, on a scale of 0 to 10 with 10 being perfect and 0 being the worst ever, where would you say you're at right now?"
"20","  Okay."
"21","  Yes, what do you think it would take to get to an 8 or a 9?"
"22","  Okay.  So I think that's all the questions I have about your diabetes for the time being, but I'd also like to delve into the fatigue you've been experiencing a little bit more.  Do you have any ideas of what might be causing the fatigue?"
"23","  Yeah.  I don't know if any of us have the energy that we had when they are that young.  Okay, so this has been going on for about six months did you notice if anything changed at all in your lives during that time?"
"24","  Okay, little more urination.  So the things that I'm hearing from you is that you've been seeing your glucose levels climb up a little bit more and you've been having increased fatigue.  You've been urinating more and then also having a little bit more trouble just standing for prolonged periods of time.  And all of those to me make me think that the diabetes and the numbers climbing up might actually be contributing to your fatigue."
"25","  How do you -- what do you think about that?"
"26","  Okay.  Do you feel like you are in a place where you can start to make changes maybe both in lifestyle and medications to improve your diabetes?"
"27","  Yeah.  Here are a couple of things that I think we might be able to do though to lower your A1c a little bit.  When you were telling me about your diet, there were a couple of things that I think we could improve on a little bit, things like that cheeseburger in the middle of the day we could substitute that.  You could still go to McDonald's close by, where you could maybe get a large salad with chicken instead.  Does that seem reasonable?"
"28","  Yeah? And then instead of maybe having two sodas a day, one during lunch and one in the evening, maybe you could choose one of those times and then only have one soda a day."
"29","  I think that's a good start on the diet front.  You're already doing a great job with exercise and the only other thing that I think we could possibly do is, right now is your metformin is at 500 mg twice a day, we could increase that to two tablets of 500 mg twice a day.  And we could meet back up in say two to four weeks and see how your blood sugars have been."
"30","  Yeah, well looking at your labs here and it's I believe the labs show that your last kidney study might be out of date and potassium study.  So we should probably get, and maybe even your lipids as well.  So we should get some basic labs first on your way out today, maybe get a typical blood cell labs, your typical electrolytes and then lipids screen too, and that will all tell us how your kidneys are functioning.  That's one thing that increasing metformin can do is it could have a negative impact on your kidneys if they are not already functioning well."
"31","  Yeah."
"32","  Okay.  So that sounds good.  The last couple of things I'm looking at here, so as far as maintenance we could think about getting your annual influenza vaccine today, is that something you're up for?"
"33","  Yeah.  And then also looks like your -- you havenâ€™t had a colonoscopy since 2011, is that correct?"
"34","  So you'd be up for your next colonoscopy screening.  We could set that up for you as well today.  And it looks like your pneumococcal I think maybe I will be able to get you an update on the pneumococcal as well."
"35","  Vaccine.  And that's all I have for your health maintenance.  Anything else you'd like to talk about today?"
"36","  Yes, yes.  So just to review really quickly, we're going to work on your diabetes management by trying to replace some soda with water, so one soda a day, trying to replace afternoon cheeseburger with a salad and chicken or whatever meat you want with that.  We'll increase your metformin.  And then on the management maintenance side, we're going to get some basic labs.  We'll send a referral for that colonoscopy and we'll be getting you a couple vaccines today."
"37","  I think all of those things combined will hopefully make you feel a little bit better and contribute to your overall health going forward."
"38","  All right, thanks so much for coming in today."
"39","  Yeah, we'll see you, bye.  All right, so I am all done."
