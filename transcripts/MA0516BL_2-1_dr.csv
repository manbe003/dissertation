"1","  Hello there."
"2","  My name is Jory Wittig.  I am a first-year medical student at Utah, and I am in here to hear about what has been going on with you lately.  Are you Freddie?"
"3","  Okay, wonderful.  Freddie, how are you doing today?"
"4","  Okay.  So I wanted to meet with you today to discuss some stuff about how your diabetes care has been going lately and how you have been feeling and then answer any questions that you have had come up recently and just make sure we kind of address all your concerns.  So can you tell me a little bit about how you have been feeling lately?"
"5","  Okay."
"6","  Okay, um, and is this occurring daily or is it after certain days when you do a lot in the morning?  Have you noticed any pattern with it?"
"7","  Okay, okay.  Umm, how have you been sleeping?"
"8","  Okay, okay, and when this tiredness comes on, do you feel like you have to lay down and rest or is it something that you can kind of push through?"
"9","  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, we do not want that for you.  So I am glad you are here so we can try and figure out why you have been feeling this way because that is not normal."
"10","  Umm. How has your diabetes been lately?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Yeah, I am looking on here.  It looks like your last, your last A1c came back at about 7.9, which is definitely a change from where we were at back in 2019 we had it down at 6.9.  So I do think that is something that, you know, we can discuss today and try and figure out how we can manage that a little better because you know a lot of times uncontrolled diabetes can have a factor in leading you to feel really fatigued and draining your energy a bit.  So you know there are other causes as well but I do think it is important to try and investigate you know the role that diabetes may be playing this is at and as well for you."
"13","  Has your diet changed at all in the past year or anything like that?"
"14","  Okay, and what is your usual diet look like?"
"15","  Okay."
"16","  Wonderful, okay."
"17","  Hmm hmm Okay."
"18","  Okay, okay, Umm.  Thank you for sharing that with me.  That is helpful to know.  And what about any sort of exercise routine that you usually follow?  Anything that you like to do or go for walks, anything like that?"
"19","  Okay, sounds."
"20","  Yeah."
"21","  Alright, good, okay.  And you know, besides this fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in your health in the past six months or so?"
"22","  Okay, no weight loss, no fevers, no chills, nothing like that."
"23","  Haha.  Okay, okay."
"24","  Okay.  And what about those medications that we have you on for your diabetes?  It looks like you are on metformin and glipizide.  Have you been able to take those regularly and you know, at the times every?"
"25","  Okay, okay.  And have you had any other, looking actually at your chart really quickly?  Do you have any history of like hypertension or anything like that or?"
"26","  Okay, okay, that is good to know."
"27","  Okay.  And were you ever recommended to take any statins or to take any medication for that cholesterol?"
"28","  Okay, so, yeah, you know, looking through your chart here and it looks like you do have a history of something that we call hyperlipidemia.  Has anyone ever talked to you about that before, or have you heard that term?"
"29","  Right. Yeah, exactly."
"30","  Yes, exactly.  No, you are right on it.  So yes, we have all these different types of cholesterol and all these different lipids in our body but essentially, you know, we have a good cholesterol that goes and helps get rid of the bad cholesterol.  And you know some people we do not know why, some of it is genetics, some of it is environmental, but some people just tend to hang on to that bad cholesterol a little bit more than other people and looking through your chart here, it sounds like you may have had a doctor in the past who thinks you may be one of these people whose body just kind of hangs on to that cholesterol in a way that we do not want it to and so something that I am probably going to put you on today, but we will talk more about it, is a really, really common drug that we give people called the statin and what the statin does is, it basically goes to your liver and it tells your liver to stop taking in the bad cholesterol basically, it is going to stop letting it out into the bloodstream and stop making it as much and so it is a way to help bring that cholesterol level down and that is a really important thing for someone like you who also has diabetes because those two together are our biggest concern for leading to some of the heart problems that we see with patients with type 2 diabetes.  Does that make sense at all or let me know if I lost you. Okay yeah.  So, so something that we really recommend to people is these drugs called statins.  They do not have, you know, a huge list of side effects, but there are a few that we would go through with you before we, you know, you make the decision to start it  but hopefully this will help bring your cholesterol down a bit.  The other thing that can really help lower cholesterol is diet as well, not going on a diet, but following a specific type of diet and one of the ones that we recommend is really trying to cut down on that red meat because we have also found that red meat kind of for whatever reason, again, we are not entirely sure it is these all these factors, but red meat can also kind of predispose you to increasing those cholesterol levels and that bad cholesterol that we do not want in your body and so, you know, we are not going to tell you by any means to do something that is unreasonable because in my book the best diet is something that makes sense to you, right?  You are going to eat what you want to eat, so I want to meet you where you are at but I do think if we could talk about maybe one of those meals, it sounds like if you are doing like a burger for lunch, then maybe do not just take for dinner or if you are having steak for dinner and you know that, then maybe do a different type of meat other than steak for lunch.  Does that sound like something that is reasonable?"
"31","  Yeah."
"32","  Yeah, yeah (Laughing)."
"33","  Absolutely."
"34","  They too yeah, that would be a great option.  A chicken sandwich would be perfect.  You know I always talk about this because, you know, it is easy to say I will do this, do this, do this, but if it is not possible, then we are not helping anyone.  So I want to work with you to figure out something that is helpful but I am a little bit nervous that the reason that you have been feeling so tired lately and also the reason that your A1c is up is because your diabetes is just not quite as well controlled as we want it to be and one of the best ways to control it along with the medications that we have you on is a few of these little lifestyle modifications, nothing major, but just making these little daily changes that become a habit and then hopefully can help you feel like, you know you are a little bit more in control of your diabetic care, if that makes sense?"
"35","  That is actually a really good point.  You know, something that we see with diabetes is that we do see it kind of progress in the way it affects people throughout the years as well.  It kind of starts off as your body is initially thinking you need insulin and making more of it and all this stuff and then the longer you have had diabetes, the more your body kind of adapts these mechanisms that are not so good at responding to it anymore.  It is kind of like wearing down those tires on a car after a really long time, right? We are just wear and tear.  You are like the body is trying and is doing its best, but without a little bit of extra help, it is not going to be able to keep doing it and so that is where sometimes we see patients like you come in and your A1c is going up and we are like, man, you know, we have got this medication here, but sometimes it is just the little extra push to help because your body is already working really hard to try and do what it needs to do, does that makes sense?"
"36","  Yeah, have you noticed any change with, you know, like feeling really thirsty lately or having to go use the restroom a lot and urinate? Anything like that?"
"37","  Okay, yeah.  That is another thing that we see sometimes when diabetes is, you know, just not quite as well controlled as we want it to be.  It can make you thirstier and it can also make you pee more and the reason why is because your blood sugar is higher than we want and the only way for your body to get rid of that extra sugar is to pee it out and so you are going to feel like you have to go to the restroom more because your body is trying to flush out that extra sugar that your body is holding on to because of the diabetes."
"38","  Okay.  So, you know, there is, I want to make sure we do not miss anything else today too, so I do not want to, you know, blame it all on diabetes by any means but I just, I will say it can be a bit of an insidious process that we, you know, see it rear its head in ways that we do not always expect, so sometimes that does look like fatigue for six months or so."
"39","  Umm.  Are there any other things that you have on your mind that you would like to bring up over here already?"
"40","  Yeah, absolutely no.  It is, you know, we all do get older, but fatigue is not normal.  You should not feel tired all the time, even, you know, as you are getting older, especially with you sleeping 7-8 hours a night and sleeping well, the fatigue is not something that I want you to be dealing with that you should that is normal to be dealing with, so I am glad you came in to talk about it. "
"41"," You know, I do not have you in here to do a physical test right now, but what I would really like for you to do, if it is feasible, is to try and keep track of your blood sugars over these next couple weeks and I would love it if you could just kind of write down each day what your blood sugar is before maybe lunch and then after lunch and put that in like a little notebook.  Is that something that you have done before ever had to do?"
"42","  Yeah. So, you can do it then too.  Yeah, yeah, that is fine.  "
"43","  Yeah, how have those levels looked to you lately."
"44","  Okay, okay.  And what has it is that kind of where it is normally at in the morning lately?"
"45","  Okay, yeah, so and this is before you have eaten in the morning?"
"46","  Okay, yeah.  So it sounds like it is, you know, your blood sugar is a bit higher than we want it to be right now and that is not your fault by any means.  This is just what happens sometimes with diabetes, is that it becomes a little bit harder to control that blood sugar and so we just have to try a few more things to help you control that blood sugar even better, if that makes sense."
"47","   So, I think a lot of it is going to come down to a few of the things that we talked about today.  So, you know, as I prepare for you to leave this appointment and hopefully be feeling better, I think the next best steps for you are going to be first starting you on that statin that we talked about, do you remember what that statin would be for?"
"48","   Excellent, great. "
"49","  Yes, hyperlipidemia.  So starting on that statin, I think it is going to be really helpful just in general for your health, but also in helping you control the diabetes a little bit better.  I think the second thing that we want to try and do is see if we can modify your diet a little bit, small changes, that become habit and so it would be awesome if you could keep checking that blood sugar in the morning like you have been doing and then just making a couple adjustments like we said, like maybe having a chicken sandwich for lunch if you know that your wife is making steak for dinner or maybe, you know, shooting her a text and saying, hey Annie, what are you making for dinner tonight?  And if she states, oh, chicken, like okay, maybe I can have this for lunch.  So I think just trying to cut down that level a little bit so it is not in all your meals in the day.  It is going to be important to trying to avoid some of that red meat and the other thing is trying not to put too much salt in your diet as well and so if you are someone who likes to, you know, really get like salty French fries, which is me, I love that but maybe asking for a little bit of less salt on them, small changes, just things like that and I would love it if you could keep track of your blood sugar over the next three weeks, especially if you incorporate some of those changes and then I would love for you to come back in person for an appointment where I can actually do a physical with you and I can look at your blood sugars again, look at the chart and we can discuss if we need to change management of your diabetes medically at that point using different medications."
"50","  Okay, okay.  Does that sound reasonable to you?  Do you have any questions?"
"51","  That would be my best guess, but you know part of the reason I want you coming back in three weeks as well so that we can make sure that is what we think is part of that, so especially if you are still feeling tired and that is continuing, we want to know that.  So please make sure that to let us know and let me know when you come back to that appointment."
"52","   Okay.  Any other questions for me, Freddie?"
"53","  Okay, wonderful.  Well, it was really, really wonderful talking with you today.  I am sorry you have been feeling so tired lately, and hopefully some of these changes can help so that you are not feeling tired and can be back playing with those grandkids, okay?"
"54","  Yeah. Alright. I look forward to seeing you in the office soon, okay?"
"55","  Alright, take care, bye."
