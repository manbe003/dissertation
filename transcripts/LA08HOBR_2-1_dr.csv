"3","  Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson.  My name is Melissa.  I am a fourth year medical student.  I am working with the doctor who's going to see you today.  What I want to do is kind of go over what's been going on and then kind of give you some recommendations and I'm also going to bring the doctor here with me to discuss the plan.  Does that sound good with you?"
"4","   Okay, Mr. Johnson, first of all, what would you like me to call you or address you by?"
"5","  Okay, okay Tom.  How are you doing, Tom?"
"6","  Yeah, tell me a little bit more.  It seems like you've been getting like, I read your note briefly and it says you've been having a cough, a low-grade fever, fatigue.  Tell me a little bit more."
"7","  Yeah."
"8","  Yeah."
"9","  Okay.  Have you gotten kind of a COVID swab? "
"10","  Okay and have you gotten vaccinated?"
"11","  Okay, okay, so besides the cough, a low-grade fever and the fatigue, what else are you feeling?"
"12","  Yeah.  How long has it been going on for?"
"13","  Five days, Okay.  And has it gotten worse?"
"14","  Okay.  What? What is going? What is getting worse?"
"15","  Okay.  Has a cough gotten worse?"
"16","  Okay, okay.  And is this, you feel like it's a wet cough or more of a dry cough?"
"17","   Okay.  Do you produce anything?"
"18","  And what kind of, what kind of stuff are you producing? Is it more clear? Is it green?"
"19","  Okay.  Okay.  And then in terms of your fever, did you ever measure it or did you kind of measure it on your hand or how were you measuring your fever?"
"20","  Okay, but you never kind of did."
"21","  Okay, Okay.  And do you still feel kind of hot?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay, Okay."
"24","  Okay.  Any kind of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or any GI symptoms, diarrhea, constipation, any of that sort?"
"25","  You got diarrhea.  How?  For how many days?"
"26","  Oh, okay, okay."
"27","  Okay.  So you've just been kind of your bowel movement has not changed.  It's still kind of the same as for many years it's been kind of having diarrhea.  Okay."
"28","  Okay and then any loss of smell or taste or any of that?"
"29","  Okay.  Are you eating well?"
"30","  Are you eating well?"
"31","  Okay, okay, so no change in appetite or anything?"
"32","  Any swollen glands that you feel like on your neck or on your, like this area or in your armpits any.  And what I'm checking is kind of your lymph nodes and seeing if you have any swollen or tender lymph nodes."
"33","  Okay."
"34","  Okay.  And then any chest pain or pain in the legs, or any arthritis or pain in the muscles or anything, any soreness anywhere."
"35","  Yeah.  And because of that, have you, have you been working?"
"36","  Yeah."
"37","  Yeah."
"38","  Yeah, yeah.  So, you've been working.  So prior to feeling sick, you've been kind of working in the construction."
"39","   Okay, Okay.  And is there quite a lot of people around you then?"
"40","  Okay.  Okay.  And do you guys all wear masks and kind of stay ________?"
"41","  Oh, okay, okay."
"42","  Yeah, yeah for sure.  Anyone around you that have been sick recently?"
"43","  Okay, okay.  No one, no one that you can think of, okay."
"44","  Not work or any family or anything?"
"45","  Okay, okay.  All right well, what I want to do is kind of check.  Well, I do want to get your vitals make sure you know, we get your blood pressure, your heart rate, look at your O2 sat, so your saturation, see all that.  I also want to get your temperature since you know you, you've been feeling a little bit warm, so I kind of want to check, oh but this is telemedicine, so we will, I think we'll kind of work our way around that.  Do you have a thermometer by any chance?"
"46","  Okay."
"47","  Yeah, yeah, that totally makes sense.  Well, I do want you to get a COVID test, just to make sure.  I know that you know, you've been feeling sick or crummy for the past five days.  So, some of these symptoms are kind of related to COVID, but some of these symptoms are also like just the common cold that you might be experiencing, so we do want to rule out anything.  In the meantime, I do want you to stay kind of quarantined, like away from like people that you know from work and in the meantime while we wait for your COVID test."
"48","  Yes, yes, in Seattle you can.  It's a kind of a drive through, so you can just drive through.  It's completely free.  You don't need.  If you have insurance, that's great.  They'll cover it for sure.  If you don't have insurance, that's also fine.  They will pay for it.  The city of Seattle provides free COVID testing for you and also another thing, you know if it does show up negative, it's most likely a common cold that you know kind of just, you know, it's more like, there's not really a medication, it's more likely a viral cold and that we want you to stay hydrated.  You know continue eating.  I'm glad that you're still eating and it hasn't in terms of like the cough and all of the other symptoms it hasn't worsened.  So that's the one thing that I'm really glad about and that there's no you know GI other like new GI symptoms or loss of smell or taste because those are all symptoms of you know what we think of COVID, so that is really reassuring, but just in case, I want to get a COVID test to make sure.  So, are you able to drive to the drivethrough and get a COVID test?"
"49","  There's a couple.  Let me I'll go back and then we'll give you a form that shows you all the sites are available that you can just, it's very easy access you just go on kind of go to your computer or your phone and you kind of sign up for it or you can just show up.  So yeah, so it's booked by appointment it's very simple and if you have trouble just let me know and then we'll try to help you arrange something or I think maybe even our clinic may have some testing, so let me double check. So you guys, you can come over to the clinic and get kind of swab, a couple of things, so it does feel like when you get swabbed, it does feel a little bit uncomfortable.  Sometimes, people say it's like a tickle up and up in the nose.  It's pretty deep up in the nose and people sneeze or you know, people cheer up a little bit, but it's only like 5 seconds and it's very fast so after that, yeah.  Other thing that I want to discuss with you is, are you interested in getting a vaccine? If it…"
"50","  Okay, okay."
"51","  Okay. Okay."
"52","  Yeah, if you, if you, if your COVID vaccine or your COVID test is negative and you're feeling better, I think then it's appropriate for you to go back to work.  I mean we don't want you to overexert yourself and you feel bad and then you know kind of something happens at work and you get injured, we don't want you to have that, so that's  something that we don't want you to have, but you know, do you work seven days a week?"
"53","  Okay, okay."
"54","  Okay, okay, because sometimes you usually like for the vaccine, we can think about getting possibly like a Johnson and Johnson on a Friday and usually, you know, have you heard of the side effects of the vaccine, you know, feeling crummy, yeah and those typically lasts up to 24 to 48 hours, so by the end of the weekend, you should feel fine to go back to work the next, you know, so that that could be also a consideration.  It's only one dose.  You get one dose and then and then you're kind of you wait two weeks and then you're fully immunized.  So, that's something to consider.  We'll discuss that after kind of your COVID test first."
"55","  Does that all sound good?"
"56","  Yeah, yeah, so I guess after we discuss this, I want kind of just overview summary, the plan is kind of, we'll have you get the COVID test and if it turns out negative, then it's most likely a kind of a viral illness that you're having and that, you know, it should be like a common cold.  If it does come positive, then we do have you quarantined and we'll monitor your symptoms and everything, so that's, that's another thing, and then later down the line, we'll discuss the vaccine. "
"57","  Okay.  Does that all sound good to you, Tom?"
"58","  Yeah, yeah.  And then you know, would love to have you come over to the clinic and get like, you know, an annual just to get your basic labs and making sure everything you're in your tip-top shape, 100% later on, so. Yeah.  Does that sound good? Do you have any questions, Tom?"
"59","  Okay, well, sounds great.  Awesome.  Well, I will have those things ordered for you and we'll get you started on your COVID test."
"60","  Okay.  Thanks, Tom."
