"1","  Hi, are you Tom?  Hi Tom, have you done a Zoom meeting like this before?  Tom, it looks like you are muted.  I am going to ask you, if you look on the left hand side of your screen at the bottom, you are going to see a little microphone that is mute.  Can you unclick it for me?"
"2","  Hey Tom, I am Morgan.  I am a third year medical student talking with you today."
"3","   How are things going?"
"4","  Yeah, it sounds like you are not feeling your best today."
"5","  Okay.  What has her worried about you?"
"6","  Okay.  How long have you been coughing for?"
"7","  Okay.  Is that a dry cough or a stuff coming up?"
"8","  Okay."
"9","  Yeah."
"10","  Yeah, a week, good amount of time.  Do you feel like it is getting any better or any worse?"
"11","  Okay and with this cough, do you have any other symptoms that you have had?"
"12","  Any sinus, runny nose, or congestion in your face?"
"13","  Okay, have you used a thermometer to check your temperature at all?"
"14","  Yeah.  So some congestion, some sore throat when you cough, it sounds like."
"15","  Right and some feeling the warm.  With this, have you noticed any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath?"
"16","  Okay and anyone else around you sick?"
"17","  Okay."
"18","  Yeah.  Have you gotten the vaccination before?"
"19","  Good, yeah.  All right, so no sick contacts that you know of.  What do you do?  You work or go out on public very often."
"20","  All right."
"21","  Yeah, me too.  What are you doing for work?"
"22","  Okay, in homes or like road construction?"
"23","  Nice, busy this time of the year, then?"
"24","  But no one the ________."
"25","  Yeah, but no crew members sick that you know of."
"26","  Okay, good.  Have you tried any medications or anything for this yet?"
"27","  Hmm hmm.  Whether they helpful at all?"
"28","  Okay.  How has your sleep been with this?"
"29","  Hm hm, yeah.  Pretty disruptive it sounds like."
"30","  Yeah.  Have you ever had a cough like this before?"
"31","  Okay.  Any history of smoking?"
"32","  Okay.  Any chest pain when you breathe in deeply?"
"33","  Okay, and any history of allergies?"
"34","  All right."
"35","  Yeah, it is pretty good cough you have got, is not it?  All right, so no history of allergies, so you know any sneezing or anything along with this one?"
"36","  Okay, all right.  Before we move on to a plan for this, I know I saw something about wanting a general checkup."
"37","  Okay."
"38","  When is the last time you have been in for just like a general checkup?"
"39","  Okay."
"40","  Yeah, do not feel like you are sick or anything like that.  It does not sound like."
"41","   Have you ever been diagnosed with anything by a doctor?"
"42","  All right.  Ever been told you have high blood pressure or high sugars?"
"43","  _______ and anything in particular that you are concerned about today?"
"44","  All right.  With this, the things I like to check on, do you ever get any swelling in your ankles?"
"45","  Chest pain when you are working."
"46","  Yeah, no, I cannot listen to your heart, so I try to ask questions to get a hint on how they occur?"
"47","  Yeah.  When you are not sick, do you get any shortness of breath or difficulty breathing?"
"48","  Okay, good.  How is your mood overall?"
"49","  Okay, good.  And any changes to your vision or your hearing lately?"
"50","  Okay.  Do you see an eye doctor or a dentist?"
"51","  Okay, yeah.  I am just going to put them on your radar for the future.  They are always good to check in on if you need them.  With this, I know you mentioned that you have not smoked ever.  Tell me about your drinking?"
"52","  Yeah. Do you drink at all?"
"53","  Okay.  What does the couple mean?"
"54","  Okay.  So nightly you are having about two or three, weekends can be more, it sounds like."
"55","  Yeah, with that kind of what is the most you will drink in a sitting?"
"56","  Okay.  And do you drink anything other than beer?"
"57","  All right and with this, do you ever drink in the mornings?  Feel like you need to get the drink just to start the day?"
"58","  Okay.  Is anyone around you ever worried about your drinking?"
"59","  All right.  And for you this is like 2-3 at night is that, has that increased or decreased at all?"
"60","  All right.  And other than alcohol, any marijuana or drugs not prescribed to you that you use?"
"61","  Yea."
"62","  All right, best to avoid it if you can and any family history I should know about?"
"63","  Okay and you are 58, correct?."
"64","  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?"
"65","  All right.  Did they make you do."
"66","  Yeah, and you have to ________."
"67","  Anything come back out of the ordinary with that?"
"68","  Okay, normal colonoscopy is good.  We would like to get those every 10 years."
"69","   Yes, All right.  Looking at that you are working.  Who do you live with?"
"70","  All right and are you staying fairly physically active in your life?"
"71","  All right.  With that, do you have any worries about like, workplace safety?"
"72","  Good.  No big falls or anything then"
"73","  Good.  How is your diet at home?"
"74","  Good.  Are you just eat a variety of foods?  Are you vegetarian?"
"75","  Hahaha."
"76","  Okay."
"77","  Are you used to work at a pizza place."
"78","  Yes, I know Meat Eaters."
"79","  Oh.  Other than pizza during game nights, are you eating out very often?"
"80","  Okay.  Who is the cook at your house?"
"81","  Yeah, All right.  I think those are all the questions I have for you.  Do you get any headaches at all?"
"82","  All right.  Like any changes in your vision recently that you have noticed?"
"83","  All right and any difficulties with urinating or going to the bathroom in general?"
"84","  Okay, pretty regular when you have a bowel movement."
"85","  Hmm, yeah, okay.  So looking at a game plan, is there anything we have not talked about yet that you would be interested in talking about?"
"86","  All right.  This week of cough and congestion that you are having, could be several things.  It is difficult to tell over telehealth, but I do think it would be reasonable for you to get tested for COVID, just to rule it in and out, or because lots of workplaces want you when you come in with a cough to get tested anyways."
"87","  Yeah.  So, I think it would be reasonable to do that.  Have you had one of those tests before?"
"88","  Yeah."
"89","  Yes, it is brief and the results are coming back faster and faster as we get better tests."
"90","  Yeah.  In the meantime, I know it does not sound like the NyQuil or the DayQuil has been super helpful, sometimes I would recommend continuing that, but things like Flonase that you can put in a little nasal spray into your sinuses also might help with your symptoms to kind of calm down that cough and that sinus congestion."
"91","  One thing we watch for this kind of thing is a lot of times they are viruses, which means we do not have any great medication for them, but if you continue to get stay sick without getting any better in the next 3, 4, or 5 days, I would want to hear back from you and see if we might want to do an antibiotic for you."
"92","  Yeah, a lot of the times though, this will pass before then or at least improve, so we just want to keep a close eye on you."
"93","  As far as your kind of overall wellness, I do not see anything I am really concerned about with your heart or your lungs.  Sounds like you are physically active, not having any problems that would make me think you needed another colonoscopy any sooner than the 10 years."
"94","  I am a little concerned about your drinking.  It is a little bit more than I would like.  Do you have any concerns about that at all?"
"95","  Okay.  One thing that I worry about with people, who drink alcohol on a regular basis is it does have some long-term effects on their body.  It can cause high blood pressure.  It can harm your liver and it can be really hard on your heart and sometimes increase risk for diabetes."
"96","  Okay.  And interestingly, beer has a lot of carbs, a lot of calories, which is one of the reasons we do worry about it with diabetes."
"97"," Yeah.  Even though it is a drink, it is still got a good amount of calories."
"98","   I know, you are not super worried about it right now, but I just want to put it on your radar that if that is something you want to ever cut back on or reduce, there is good health benefits for it and it is something that we can help with honestly."
"99","  Okay.  Speaking of that, have you ever had any like alcohol withdrawal or if you have gone without a drink, you have gotten kind of shaky?"
"100","  Okay, good.  Good to hear.  With you, I think just because it has been a long time since you have been to the doctor, I would like to get some annual labs to look at your cholesterol, your liver health, your kidney health and just your blood sugars?  Is that something you would be interested in?"
"101","  Okay.  Why something to consider instead of a definite yes, I want lab work."
"102","  Yeah. I think it is really great for your health to have a baseline, so we know that when you are healthy and at your normal what your lab work, your liver and your kidney looks like, so if ever anything changes, we notice it right away."
"103","  Yes, all right.  Other than labs and the COVID test and may be consider some Flonase for that sinus pressure on your cough, I think that is all my plan for today."
"104","  Do you have any questions or concerns?"
"105","  All right.  Do you feel like that sounds like a reasonable plan on your end?"
"106","   Okay, all right.  I think that is all I have got for you today, Tom."
"107","  Yeah, it was nice talking with you."
"108","  Yeah.  Do you know how to leave the meeting?"
