"1","  Good morning Freddie.  How are you?"
"2","  Pretty good.  Um, so my name is Moira and I am going to be the medical student seeing you today over telehealth.  How are you doing today?  Oh."
"3","  Hi. Yeah, you were, you were frozen for a second."
"4","  Yeah."
"5","  Yeah, I was asking how do you, how do you feel you are doing today?  I know you are here to discuss your diabetes.  Has there been anything else going on recently?"
"6","  Yeah.  Well, it is great to see you again.  Have you been, I see you are on the metformin and the glipizide.  Have you been tolerating those okay?"
"7","  Great.  And have you had any hypoglycemia recently where you feel like your blood sugar is getting really low?"
"8","  No. Okay.  Do you? Do you check your sugars at all at home?"
"9","  Great. And what are you, what would you say they have been averaging in the past couple of months?"
"10","  Okay.  Yeah.  Has anything changed in the past year?  I know we haven't seen you in a while.  So, just trying to see has any anything different in your life?"
"11","  Okay."
"12","  Got it.  What about at night?  How many times do you wake up at night to go to the bathroom?"
"13","  Sure. Yeah.  And have you, is that also a change in the past year or so?"
"14","  Okay.  And can you tell me a little bit about what you drink in a day?  Do you drink coffee, tea, water or soda?"
"15","  Great, great.  And do you drink any alcohol?"
"16","  Okay.  And then you said in the past six months, you have noticed you, you are more fatigued.  Can you tell me a little bit more about that and what you have noticed?"
"17","  Yeah, yeah, that is, that must be hard, especially because it sounds like your wife is able to keep up with your grandkids still."
"18","  Okay.  And then can you tell me a little bit about what your exercise regimen is like?  Do you, do you have any structured exercise?  Or is it other than just daily, daily activities."
"19","  Okay, great, great.  And a couple of more questions.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?"
"20","  And what's that been averaging?"
"21","  Okay.  And do you have any trouble lying flat at night? Do you prop yourself up with pillows?  Or can you sleep pretty comfortably?"
"22","  Okay."
"23","  Okay.  What about any family history of heart problems?"
"24","   Okay, great.  Good to know.  And I am looking at your chart.  Have you ever had a stress test done to see how your heart is functioning?"
"25","  You have not.  Okay, yeah.  So you are kind of getting to the age where we might consider trying something like a stress test, just to make sure that your fatigue is not caused by any kind of heart problem.  But there are a couple of other things we can try as well.  Last time, we checked your A1c, I don't know if you remember what your A1c was, but it was a little bit high."
"26","  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that, that is another thing that could be contributing to your fatigue potentially is some of these higher blood sugars and you mentioned that you have noticed your blood sugars going into the yellow zone.  Can you tell me a little more about what your diet has been like recently?"
"27","  Fried chicken.  Okay, okay.  What about any vegetables or fruits in there?  Or is that kind of, that is a typical, typical day."
"28","  Okay. All right, yeah.  So, there are definitely some dietary tweaks I think you could make.  For one, your, your blood sugars are running higher than we would like to see.  And I think it would be good to check that A1c again, just to make sure it is not continuing to climb.  You are tolerating your meds well, it sounds like, so that might be something we can tweak.  But how would you feel about potentially talking to a nutritionist with your wife to see about some potentially changes you could make at home?  Would you be open to that?"
"29","  Yeah, so I think the major benefit is that there is a lot of sugar in your diet that I think you could, you could make some small adjustments that might help you feel less fatigued and might improve your blood sugar, like for instance, you drink soda, perhaps we could switch that to something like carbonated beverages, like sparkling water.  But I think there are just some other tips that a nutritionist could perhaps help you with and seeing as your wife does the cooking, it might be useful for her to go with you."
"30","  Yeah.  And then I would like to go up on your metformin if you are okay with that.  Do you, do you not have any stomach problems from the metformin?"
"31","  Okay.  Would you be open to trying that as well?"
"32","  Yeah, I was thinking your current dose, it looks like you take 500 mg twice daily with meals."
"33","  You are taking 500 mg in the morning and 500 mg at night, correct?"
"34","  I would like to increase that to 1000 mg in the morning and 1000 mg at night."
"35","  Does that, does that sound like a good plan?"
"36","  Okay.  And then, I would like to refer you to have a stress test done."
"37","  And that would be with cardiologist and we can have them scheduled that for you just to make sure your heart is functioning well.  And if that looks good, there are a couple of other things we can evaluate for your fatigue."
"38","  Well, one thing we probably want to look at after that is your breathing.  Have you ever smoked?"
"39","  No.  Okay, great, great.  So, something we think about is potentially COPD, asthma.  Do you have a history of asthma?"
"40","  Okay.  And then other things we can check are some blood work to rule out anemia as a possible cause of fatigue, potentially even sleep apnea, do you know if you snore at night?"
"41","  Okay, she would, she would be the one to know."
"42","  Okay, yeah.  So that is, those are a couple of other things we can explore.  We can explore some for the anemia, you may have lost some blood.  Those are just things that I would, I would want to check if the stress test looks perfect."
"43","  Sorry, someone is here to get them, I believe, they are going bark for a sec."
"44","  All right, they might be stopping now.  So, anyway Freddie, does that, does that sound like a plan to start with?"
"45","  Yeah.  And then for the urination, there is a medication we could try called oxybutynin.  Would you be interested in trying that?  Or do you want to make the other changes first?"
"46","  Okay, all right.  So, to summarize, I would like to refer you to the nutritionist, I will place the referral for the stress test for your heart and then, I will send an increased dose of your metformin to the pharmacy today.  And then, would it be okay if we checked in, in about three months?"
"47","  Great.  And could you do blood work before that appointment?  Is that easy for you to get done?"
"48","  Okay, yeah.  If you just let me know a lab, we can send orders to that lab and have you, have you do that before we meet again via telehealth, I think would be great."
"49","  All right.  Well, it was great seeing you today Freddie."
"50","  Yeah, um, you know, I think, I think there are some things that you can change that will help you feel better.  Your A1c has definitely been rising for a bit, which is, which is a little bit concerning to me.  But otherwise, it seems like most of your, you do not have any red flags for serious conditions.  But I do want to get the stress test."
"51","  No, I don't, I don't think that is the case at all.  No, I think I mean, you are 60 and think you have a lot of good years ahead of you.  There are just, just some things we can tweak to give you a better quality of life for longer."
"52","  Perfect, all right."
"53","  Bye."
