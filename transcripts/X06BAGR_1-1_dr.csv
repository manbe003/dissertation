"1","  Hello, Freddie."
"2","  Hello, my name is Matt.  I am a medical student with the University of Washington School of Medicine."
"3","  Hi, I have been sent into ask you a few questions and see what your concerns are."
"4","  If you forgive me, I am actually moving right now and so my baby sleeping in another room, so moving to the garage."
"5","  Yes, yes.  Freddie, what brings you in today?"
"6","  Hmm."
"7","  Hmm.  What have they been lately?"
"8","  Hmm, hmm.  And have you had any changes to your diet?"
"9","  Okay, any changes to your level of activity?"
"10","  Hmm, absolutely, okay.  And then are you taking your medications that you prescribed, the metformin and glipizide?"
"11","   All right.  Freddie, what, what is most the time for you?  Is it, you know, two days a week, three days a week?"
"12","  Okay, okay, all right.  Those are great medications for lowering your blood sugar.  Is there any, is there any side effects for those medications that you do not like?"
"13","  Okay, okay, good to know, good to know.  Some people have a feeling, but that is good for you that it has not.  And then have you been feeling ill lately and any cough or cold? Night sweats or fever?"
"14","  Okay.  And have you recently started any steroid medications or any other medications that were not listed here?"
"15","   Okay. okay.  All right, hmm.  Feel it, let me, just let me think for a second about anything else that I need to ask.  Is there anything else that you can think of that could be causing this, your sugars to rise a little?"
"16","  Okay, okay, that is okay.  That is all right.  I am looking at your A1c and it also has been rising over the last, about two years.  Have we had you on metformin?  I cannot see with the chart, but have we had you on metformin and glipizide the same dose this whole time?"
"17","  Okay, all right, okay.  Umm, I have a few more just kind of general questions I would like to ask and these might not be specific to your case, but just a review of systems I would like to go through.  Have you felt lightheaded or faint recently?"
"18","  Okay, any headaches or changes to your vision?"
"19","  Hmm, do you regularly see an eye doctor for your diabetes?"
"20","  Okay.  I will put in in a referral for that.  Any changes to your smell or taste?"
"21","  Okay, any body aches, fatigue, malaise?"
"22","  Really.  How long have you felt more tired?"
"23","  Hmm."
"24","  Okay.  Are you tired when you wake up in the morning?"
"25","  Yeah, yeah, okay.  And do you sleep well at night?  Do you feel?"
"26","  Yeah, yeah, have you noticed that in the last few months as well, increased urination at night?"
"27","  Okay, all right.  Have you noticed any swelling in your limbs, especially your legs?"
"28","  Okay, all right.  And then do you feel like you are drinking more water or liquid than usual?"
"29","  More thirsty?"
"30","  Thirsty all the time, I am guessing."
"31","  okay, all right.  Hm and then any trouble with your heart?  Have you ever had any one say there was anything wrong with your heart or your lungs?"
"32","  Okay, you are not experiencing any palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest pain?"
"33","  Okay.  Any, I am just going from head to toe with this kind of review of systems, sorry, I should tell you that, any nausea, vomiting?"
"34","  Okay.  Constipation or diarrhea?"
"35","  Okay.  Any abdominal pain?"
"36","  Okay and then keep on moving down, you said that you are, you are peeing more fancy word for polyuria?  And then any trouble maintaining erection?"
"37","  Okay, okay."
"38","  Yeah, okay.  Do you ever, does the people you live with, do they ever find that you are waking up gasping for air? You are snoring loudly?"
"39","  Okay, okay, but not waking up gasping for air."
"40","  No and are you able to sleep with just one pill or do you need to prop yourself up quite a bit?"
"41","  One pillow, okay, all right.  Well, and just a few more questions in that review of systems.  Do you find any pins and needles or tingling in your hands or feet or loss of sensation?"
"42","  Okay, all right, good.  And then any recent falls?"
"43","  Perfect, all right.  Well, Freddie, I think,  I think tying everything together, you say that you feel tired all the time and you feel like you are urinating more and more thirsty and your sugars have been rising.  This may signal a few things.  One, it could just signal that your diabetes is progressing.  Diabetes is a progressive disease.  We can slow it down greatly with diet and exercise, all the things we should be doing.  But it still will progress a little by a little and I think that the medication we have had you on is not enough for you."
"44","  What do you think about that?"
"45","  Thank you.  Yeah, we always want to start with a little things like diet and exercise, and I can have the referral to PT or exercise program if you would like."
"46","  All right, all right.  You think about it and get back to me.  I think what we will do is we will increase your metformin.  That is the drug that you take, that is 500 mg and I think what we will do is we will double it, so you take 500 mg in the morning and 500 mg at night."
"47","  Many times when people start this drug or increase dosage, they can have some kind of loose stools.  This will go away within a week or two.  Yeah, yeah, I tell you, so you are not surprised by it."
"48","  Yeah.  I think also we might want to increase your glipizide.  Are you able to come, I am sorry, I should have asked, do you have your sugars written down if you could send those?"
"49","  That is fine.  If you could send those to me and if you could e-mail me maybe in two weeks with the last two weeks after we increase that metformin, that would be great because we may increase your glipizide and I will write a prescription for it and fold that on my desk.  And then if we are saying, those sugars are not coming up or coming down, we will send it to you.  This should also, oh, sorry."
"50","  Okay, this should also help your peeing that you are peeing, oh, what seems like a lot.  What happens is the sugar in your blood causes your kidneys not to work exactly right and so they can pull water out like a diuretic and so, this should help with peeing.  If it does not, please let me know."
"51","  Okay.  Trying to think, do you have any other questions for me?"
"52","  Okay.  Well, I hope this is a good start to getting you feeling better and if you have any other questions, I, I welcome and you reach out to me.  You know how to get to me."
"53","  Okay.  Thank you very much, Freddie."
"54","  Have a great day.  Do I leave? Oh, no, I raised my hand.  I am so sorry."
